Text: formulas for the supersonic loading, lift and dragof flat swept back wings with leading edges behindthe mach lines .  the method of superposition of linearized conical flows hasbeen applied to the calculation of the aerodynamic properties, insupersonic flight, of thin flat, swept-back wings at an angle ofattack .  the wings are assumed to have rectilinear plan forms,with tips parallel to the stream, and to taper in the conventionalsense .  the investigation covers the moderately supersonic speedrange where the mach lines from the leading-edge apex lie aheadof the wing .  the trailing edge may lie ahead of or behind themach lines from its apex .  the case in which the mach conefrom one tip intersects the other tip is not treated .  formulas are obtained for the load distribution, the total lift,and the drag due to lift .  for the cases in which the trailing edgeis outside the mach cone from its apex (supersonic trailing edge),the formulas are complete .  for the wing with both leading andtrailing edges behind their respective mach lines, a degree ofapproximation is necessary .  it has been found possible to givepractical formulas which permit the total lift and drag to becalculated to within 2 or 3 percent of the accuratelinearized-theory value .  the local lift can be determined accurately overmost of the wing, but the trailing-edge-tip region is treated onlyapproximately .  charts of some of the functions derived are included tofacilitate computing, and several examples are worked out in outline .
