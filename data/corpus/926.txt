Text: post buckling behaviour of circular cylinderical shellsunder hydrostatic pressure .  the postbuckling behavior of initially perfect, thin-walled,circular cylindrical shells under hydrostatic pressure isinvestigated with the aid of the principle of stationary potential energytogether with appropriate approximate deflection functions .calculations show that postbuckling equilibrium configurationsexist for loads greater than as well as loads slightly less than thecritical load calculated from small-deflection theory .  loadsless than the critical load are obtained only for a finite range of aparameter indicative of shell geometry .  for loads correspondingto radial displacements of the order of the shell thickness, it isfound that the number of circumferential waves remainessentially constant with increasing deflection and equal to thenumber of waves developed at buckling .
