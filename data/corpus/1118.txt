Text: elastic stability of orthotropic shells .  a small-deflection theory for general instability of orthotropiccircular cylindrical shells has been derived for external pressure,torsion, and axial compression .  for the first two types ofloading, comparison of the theory with experimental data fororthotropic cylinders reveals agreement comparable with thatobtained for isotropic shells .  for axial compression, experimentaldata have been found to agree reasonably well with theory fororthotropic cylinders, in contrast to the agreement usuallyobtained for isotropic cylinders .
