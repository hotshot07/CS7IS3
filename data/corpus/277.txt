Text: study of flow conditions and deflection angle at exitof two-dimensional cascade of turbine rotor bladesat critical and supercritical pressure ratios .  an analysis was made of the flow conditions downstream of acascade of turbine rotor blades at critical and supercriticalpressure ratios .  the results of five theoretical methods fordetermining the deflection angle are compared with those of an experimentalmethod using the conservation-of-momentum principle andstatic-pressure surveys, and also are compared with an analysis ofschlieren photographs of the flow downstream of the blades .  a two-dimensional cascade of six blades with an axial width of 1.80 incheswas used for the static-pressure surveys and for some of theschlieren photographs .  in order to determine the flow conditions severalblade chords downstream of the cascade, schlieren photographs weretaken of the flow through a cascade of 18 blades having an axialwidth of 0.60 inch .  for the blade design studied, even at static-to-total pressureratios considerably lower than that required to give criticalvelocity at the throat section, the flow was deflected in the tangentialdirection as predicted for the incompressible case .  as the pressureratio was lowered further, the aerodynamic loading of the rearportion of the blade reached a maximum value and remained constant .after this condition was attained, the expansion downstream of thecascade took place with a constant tangential velocity so that nofurther increase in the amount of turning across the blade row andno further increase in the loading of the blade was available .
