Text: evaluation of high angle-of-attack aerodynamic derivativedata and stall-flutter prediction techniques .  the problem of stall flutter is approached in two ways .  first,using the m.i.t.-naca airfoil oscillator, the aerodynamic reactions onwings oscillating harmonically in pitch and translation in the stallrange have been measured, evaluated, and correlated where possible withavailable published data, with the purpose of providing empiricalinformation where no aerodynamic theory exists .  the major effects ofreynolds number, airfoil shape, and reduced frequency on the aerodynamicreactions have been reaffirmed .  no instances of negative damping wereobserved in pure translatory motion and the ranges of negative dampingoccurring in pure pitch had the same general trends noted by otherexperimenters .  data on the time-average values in the stall range ofboth lift and moment are presented for the first time .  second, the results of numerous experimental observations of stallflutter have been reviewed and the various known attempts at itsprediction have been examined, compared, and extended .  the sharp drop incritical speed and change to a predominantly torsional oscillationusually associated with the transition from classical to stall flutteris apparently primarily but not entirely caused by the marked changesin moment due to pitch .  fairly good stall-flutter predictions havebeen reported only when adequate empirical data for this aerodynamicreaction happened to be available for the desired airfoil shape,reynolds number range, and reduced-frequency range .  a semiempiricalmethod of predicting the variations of moment in pitch with airfoilshape, reduced frequency, initial angle of attack, and amplitude ofoscillation has been presented .
