Text: the lift of twisted and cambered wings in supersonic flow .a generalised conical flow theory is used to deduce an integral equation relating the velocity potential on a delta wing/with subsonic leadingedges/to the given downwash distribution over the wing . the completesolution of this integral equation is derived . this complete solutionis composed of two parts, one being symmetric and the otherantisymmetric with respect to the spanwise co-ordinate,. each partrepresents a velocity potential . for example, if y is the spanwiseco-ordinate and x is measured in the free stream direction, then adownwash of the form w-a ux/y/is symmetric and will give rise to asymmetric potential, whereas w-a ux/y/sgn y is anti-symmetric and givesrise to an anti-symmetric potential . the velocity potentials of suchflows are given in the form of tables for all downwashes up to andincluding homogenous cubics in the spanwise and streamwiseco-ordinates . table iii gives similar formulae in the limiting casewere used over a cycle of the tumbling motion . the analyticalexpression was in good agreement with numerical solutions of the completenon-linear equations of motion .
