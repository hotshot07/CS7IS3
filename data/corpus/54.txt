Text: method for calculation of compressible laminar boundarylayer characteristics in axial pressure gradient withzero heat transfer .  the karman-pohlhausen method is extended primarily to sixth-degreevelocity profiles for determiningthe characteristics of the compressiblelaminar boundary layer over an adiabaticwall in the presence of an axialpressure gradient .  it is assumed that the prandtl number is unity andthat the coefficient of viscosity varies linearly with the temperature .a general approximate solution which permits a rapid determination ofthe boundary-layer characteristics for any given free-stream mach numberand given velocity distribution at the outer edge of the boundary layeris obtained .  numerical examples indicate that this solution will inpractice lead to results of satisfactoryaccuracy, including the criticalreynolds number for stability .  for the special purpose of calculatingthe location of the separation point in an adverse pressure gradient, ashort and simple method, based on the use of a seventh-degree velocityprofile, is derived .  the numerical example given here indicates thatthis method should in practice lead to sufficiently accurate results .for the special case of flow near a forward stagnation point it is shownthat the karman-pohlhausen method with the usual fourth-degree profilesleads to results of adequate accuracy, even for the critical reynoldsnumber .
