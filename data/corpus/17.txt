Text: remarks on the eddy viscosity in compressible mixing flows .in connection with a study of the wakes behind bodies in hypersonic flowcarried out for the missile and space vehicle division of the generalelectric company, it was desired to estimate the eddy viscosity inaxisymmetric, compressible wakes .  because of the lack of applicableexperimental data, it was found necessary to make such an estimate byrationally extending the few available data for incompressible flows tothe compressible case .  this suggested the application and extension ofthe transformations applied to turbulent boundary layers in referenceinfinitesimal mass are invariant with transformation, mager showed thatthe partial differential equations for the compressible turbulentboundary layer can be transformed to incompressible form .  the validity ofthis assumption and of the transformations was established for severalboundary-layer flows by comparison with experiment .
