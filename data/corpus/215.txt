Text: the test performance of highly loaded turbine stagesdesigned for high pressure ratio .  a blade design for a highly loaded two-stageturbine is described and the test performance ofthe turbine is presented .  some of the factors affecting the performance and matchingof turbine blade rows operating at supersonicgas velocity are discussed and investigated by means of testson a three-dimensional nozzle cascade tunneland on a variety of single-stage turbine builds .
