Text: the shear flow along a flat plate with uniform suction .  recently, several authors have investigated the boundarylayer in a shear flow .  in this note, an exact solution of thenavier-stokes equations will be presented, which represents theboundary layer along an infinite flat plate with uniform suctionsituated in a shear flow .
