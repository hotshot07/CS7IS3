Text: boundary layer over a flat plate in presence of shearflow .  the governing equations of an incompressibleboundary layer over a flat plate in the presence of ashear flow with finite vorticity are derived .  for largevorticity, a similarity solution is obtained .  formoderate vorticity, one of the governing equationsis replaced by an approximate one for whichsimilarity solutions exist .
