Text: note on the hypersonic similarity law for an unyawedcone .  it is now known that the hypersonic similarity law derived forslender cones and ogival bodies under the assumption, isapplicable for mach numbers as low as 3 .  this note makes use ofa series development to infer the hypersonic similarity law forunyawed cones from the taylor-maccoll differential equations andassociated boundary conditions .  a simple approximate formulafor the function of the similarity law is obtained,and the drag function computed with this formula is comparedwith kopal's numerical results and, for very slender cones, withvon karman's linearized formula .
