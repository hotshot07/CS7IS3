Text: experimental measurements of turbulent transition motion,statistics and gross radial growth behind hypervelocity object.  the laminar-turbulent transition behind 0.500-in.-diameterspheres at 8500 ft sec and behindmeasured as a function of pressure .  schlierenmotion-picture techniques were used to analyze theturbulent motion and the results are described .autocorrelation functions of the density fluctuationsof the turbulence have been measured .  fromthese values has been calculated and the resultsare given for several positions in the turbulenttrail at 30 mm hg downstream air pressure .  in additionthe authors' previous measurements of thegross radial growth of the turbulent wake have beenextended to pressures of 10 mm hg for the caseof 0.500-in.-diameter spheres and to the trail behind
