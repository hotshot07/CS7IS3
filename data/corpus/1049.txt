Text: elastic constants for corrugated core sandwich plates .  the sandwich plate consisting ofcorrugated sheet fastened betweentwo face sheets is considered .  applicationof existing theories to theanalysis of such a sandwich plate requiresthe knowledge of certainelastic constants .  formulas and charts arepresented for the evaluationof these constants .  the formulas for threeof these constants werechecked experimentally and found to givevalues in close agreement withthe experimental values .
