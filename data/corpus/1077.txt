Text: a method of solution with tabulated results for the attached obliqueshock wave system for surfaces at various angles of attack, sweep, anddihedral in an equilibrium real gas including the atmosphere .a new method is derived for solving the attached oblique shock-wavesystem for surfaces at various angles of attack, sweep, and dihedral inany real gas in equilibrium . results are tabulated for the followingranges .. angle of attack, 0degree to 65degree,. angle of sweep, 0degree to 75degree,. angle of dihedral, 0degree to 30degree,. mach number, 3to 30,. and /effective specific-heat ratio/ parameter, 1.10 to 1.67 .both the method and tabulated solutions are easily adaptable to flightin any gas or in the atmosphere of any planet . an illustrative exampleis presented based on the ardc 1956 model atmosphere .
