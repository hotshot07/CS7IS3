Text: experimental ablation cooling .  this paper presents the resultsof an experimental investigation onthe ablation of a number of promisingmaterials for heating conditionscomparable to those which may beencountered by unmanned reentrysatellite vehicles, as well as for higherheating conditions comparable tothose associated with reentry ballisticmissiles .  materials testedincluded the plastics teflon, nylon,and lucite,. the inorganic saltsammonium chloride and sodium carbonate,.graphite,. a phenolic resin andfiber glass composition,. and thecommercial material haveg rocketon .results of these tests indicatedheat-absorption capabilities which areseveral times greater than those ofcurrent metallic heat-sink materials .the results with teflon showed thatfor hemispherical noses there was noapparent effect of size orstagnation-point pressure on ablation ratefor the range of variables covered inthe tests .  for flat-facedconfigurations, however, there was a definiteincrease in the ablation rate withincreased stagnation-point pressure .the results for the severalmaterials tested at heating ratesassociated with reentry ballisticmissiles showed considerable increasein the effective heats of ablationover the results obtained at lowerheating rates .  this trend ofincreased effectiveness with increasedheating potential is inagreement with the predictions of ablationtheories .  comparisons of theresults for several materials testedat the higher heating rates showedgraphite to have the lowest ablationrate of all materials tested .
