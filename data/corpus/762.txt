Text: allowable axial loads and bending moments for inelastic structuresunder nonuniform temperature distribution .a strain-analysis method is derived and demonstrated for thecalculation of design allowable load-strain curves for the cross sectionof a structure supporting axial loads and bending moments .  thetemperature effects of thermal stresses and changed material propertiesand all inelastic effects are included in the calculations so thatthe final curve is a design curve for the applied stresses as calculatedby room-temperature elastic procedures .  the method allows for sequenceapplication and removal of load and temperature, as well as cyclingof load and/or temperature .  applications are shown for a rectangularbar under temperature cycling with axial loads and/or bending momentsand for a box beam with one bending-moment temperature cycle .interaction curves beyween axial load and bending moment with inelasticeffects included are given, the calculations being done on a digitalcomputer .  a procedure is given for using the method to constructdesign curves .
