Text: principles of creep buckling weight-strength analysis .  the determination of column deflections andcolumn buckling loads has been considered formany years .  the available theories, however,do not provide for materials which creep withtime under constant loads .  for the design ofstructural members made of these materials, aconsideration of creep may be of practicalimportance .  plastics, concrete, and some metalscreep at normal temperatures while othermetals creep only at high temperatures and at stressvalues beyond the yield point .  a considerationof creep in the design of some structures appearsappropriate in view of the modern developmentsin plastics and the presence of high stress valueswhich are sometimes beyond the yield stress .this paper gives a rational theory for predictingcreep deflections in columns .  a special caseusing this theory is applied to the interpretation ofsome preliminary tests of an aluminum alloy .
