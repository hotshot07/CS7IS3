Text: a simplified approximate method for the calculation of the pressurearound conical bodies of arbitrary shape in supersonic and hypersonicflow .exact conical-flow solutions are available only for circular cones atzero angle of attack .  for nonaxisymmetric cones or cones at angle ofattack, only approximate methods exist .  these methods are generallyquite complicated and further limited to certain body shapes or certainmach-number ranges .  a great need was therefore felt for a simpleapproximate method applicable to any arbitrarily shaped conical body atzero incidence as well as at angle of attack .such a method has been developed recently at lockheed and is presentedhere in abbreviated form .  the method is based on the /equivalent-cone/theory .  this theory determines the pressure on a conical bodyutilizing information for a symmetric cone at zero angle of attack with thesame normal component of the free stream with respect to the surface asthe local element of the body considered .  this method works relativelywell at high mach numbers .  however, it is quite inconsistent at lowermach numbers, especially for bodies which deviate considerably fromcircular cones .  the equivalent-cone method does not give satisfactoryresults, mainly due to the fact that it considers only the local surfaceelement on the body independent of the other body elements in thenewtonian-theory manner .
