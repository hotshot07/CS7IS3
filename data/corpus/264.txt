Text: asymptotic solution of the two dimensional oscillatingaerofoil problem for high subsonic mach numbers .  a new method has been given, for obtaining asymptotic solutions of aboundary value problem for the wave equation .  the method is simplerthan the method previously given by burger, and leads to a resultidentical with burger's result .
