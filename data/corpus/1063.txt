Text: on obtaining solutions to the navier-stokes equationswith high speed digital computers .  the purpose of this paper isto show how to obtain steadystate solutions to the navier-stokesequations on a high-speed digitalcomputer .  first the relative meritsof various finite differenceformulae are discussed .  thereafterthe main part of the paper isconcerned with the methods used tosolve the finite differenceequations and an investigation is madeof all the simpler iterativemethods .
