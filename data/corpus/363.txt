Text: an alternative formulation of the problem of flutterin real fluids .it is well known, in steady flow, that the actual lift curveslope is somewhat less than that predicted by inviscid flowtheory, even at small angles of attack .  as the stall angle isapproached, the lift curve slope continually decreases and thusdeviates even more from the theoretical value .  pinkertonemployed the measured circulation to determine the pressuredistribution and found that the resulting prediction of the momentis considerably improved over that given by the classical theory .this amounts to replacing the conventional kutta-joukowskicondition with the condition that the total lift should agree withthe measured value, and this, in turn, completely determines theflow pattern .  practically, this is accomplished by giving afictitious camber to the profile .  since potential flow theory isvalid outside of the boundary layer, once the boundary-layerthickness is known, the potential flow may be corrected for thedisplacement thickness and the viscous wake by appropriatesource distributions .  the boundary layer cannot be evaluated,of course, until the potential flow is known and the circulation isapplied .  a criterion to determine the circulation, bygeneralizing the kutta-joukowski condition, was proposed by prestonand spence by assuming that the pressure at the trailing edgeshall have the same value when determined from thepotential-flow values above and below the airfoil .  this procedure givesqualitative information concerning viscous effects in steadyflow .
