Text: loads induced on a flat plate wing by an air jet exhaustingperpendicularly through the wing and normal to a free-stream flow of machnumber 2.0 .measurements were made of loads induced on a flat-plate wing by an airjet exhausting perpendicularly through the wing and normal to thefree-stream flow . the investigation was conducted at a free-stream machnumber of 2.0 and a reynolds number per foot of 14.4 x 10 . an axiallysymmetric sonic nozzle and two supersonic nozzles were employed for thejets . the supersonic nozzles consisted of an axially symmetric nozzlewith exit mach number of 3.44 and a two-dimensional nozzle with exitmach number of 1.76 . the ratio of nozzle total pressure to free-streamstatic pressure was varied from 20 to 110 .negative loads were induced on the flat-plate wing by all the jets . asthe nozzle pressure ratio was increased the magnitude of interferenceloads due to jet thrust decreased . the chordwise center-of-pressurelocation generally moved toward the nozzle center line as the pressureratio was increased .
