Text: of a turbulent free shear layer .  the problem of predicting the mean velocity on streamlinesthrough the pre-asymptotic turbulent free shear layer in two-dimensionalincompressible flow is resolved into two parts .  the linearizedmomentum equation in terms of a generalized axial co-ordinate issolved in the usual way .  a relation between and the distance fromthe separation point is then established analytically in contrast to theprevious use of empirical expressions .  it is shown that except in the region close to separation thevelocity on the streamlines can be predicted by the simple approximationproposed by kirk .
