Text: effects of leading edge bluntness on flutter characteristicsof some square- planform double-wedge airfoils at amach number of 15 .4.  results are presented from a wind-tunnelinvestigation in helium flow at amach number of 15.4 .  the models weresquare-planform, double-wedge, shaft-mountedairfoils with leading- and trailing-edgeradii of 0, 1, 3, and 6 percent chord .in general, the tests indicate that bluntnesseffects on the model fluttercharacteristics are stabilizing as the leading-edgeradius is increased from 0 todestabilizing with further increase inbluntness .  results of flutter calculations madeby using newtonian theory aerodynamicsand a combination of newtonian theory andpiston theory aerodynamics inconjunction with an uncoupled two-mode analysisare compared with experimental results .the piston-theory results accuratelypredicted flutter speeds for the models with
