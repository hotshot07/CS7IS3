Text: a unified theory of plastic buckling of columns andplates .  on the basis of modern plasticity considerations, a unifiedtheory of plastic buckling applicable to both columns and plateshas been developed .  for uniform compression, the theoryshows that long columns which bend without appreciabletwisting require the tangent modulus and that long flangeswhich twist without appreciable bending require the secantmodulus .  structures that both bend and twist when theybuckle require a modulus which is a combination of the secantmodulus and the tangent modulus .
