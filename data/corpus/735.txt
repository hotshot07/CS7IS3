Text: the bending of uniformly loaded sectorial plates withclamped edges .  this paper analyzes the bending of a sectorial plate,clamped on all edges and subjected to uniformlydistributed load, by using two different methods of superpositionon the elementary solution for a uniformly loaded circularplate with a clamped edge .
