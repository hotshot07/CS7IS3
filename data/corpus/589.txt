Text: some stall and surge phenomena in axial flow compressors .observations of rotating stall have shown that a wide varietyof stall patterns is possible .     hot-wire anemometer data on a multistage compressor haveshown a progressive-type stall at low speeds . the amplitudeof the flow fluctuations increases in magnitude through the firstfew stages and then diminishes rapidly to a small value in thelatter stages . a stage-stacking analysis has shown that rotatingstall will exist over a large portion of the compressor map at lowspeeds but will be instigated almost simultaneously withcompressor surge at high speeds .     blades failures attributable to resonant vibrations excited byrotating stall have been experienced in single  and multistagecompressors .      in the stage-stacking analysis no deterioration of stageperformance due to unsteady flow resulting from stall of adjacent stageswas considered . in general, the pressure drop at the stall pointis believed to be much larger than indicated by an analyticalformulation of compressor performance . compressor surge isattributed to a limit cycle operation about the compressor stallpoint, and, as indicated in a few compressor tests and injet-engine tests, a small compressor discharge receiver volume mayresult simply in stall of the compressor without the cycliccharacteristics of compressor surge . in this event, engine operationwill be limited because of the large drop in performance whichaccompanies compressor stall  .
