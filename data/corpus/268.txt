Text: several magnetohydrodynamic free-convection solutions .the influence of transverse magnetic fields onthe laminar free-convection flow of liquidmetals over a vertical flat plate and betweenvertical parallel plates is examined forspecific wall temperature variations andprandtl numbers .  the extent of influence onthe flow and temperature fields is determinedby the magnitude of a nondimensionalinfluence parameter which is the ratio of themagnetic force to the buoyant force .  ingeneral, increasing the magnetic field strengthdecreases the magnitude of the velocity, wallshear, and surfaces heat transfer andincreases the temperature throughout the fluid .analytical results demonstrate that magneticfields of practical strengths exertconsiderable influence on liquid metal free-convection flow fields .
