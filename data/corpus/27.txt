Text: newtonian flow theory for slender bodies .  as an aid to the aerodynamieist in the design of air frames forhypersonic speeds (speeds faster than about mach 5), newtonianflow theory is examined from the point of view of gas dynamicsand hypersonic small-disturbance theory .  the usual theory isshown to result as the first approximation of an expansion validfor small .  a basic similarity parameteris introduced .  a general solutionof the first approximation for the flow past slender bodies (bodieswhich cause only a small disturbance to the stream) at zero angleof attack is given .  an important condition which limits theapplication of the theory is noted-namely, that the pressurecoefficient on the surface not fall to zero .  the theory is thenapplied to cones and to bodies whose shape is .
