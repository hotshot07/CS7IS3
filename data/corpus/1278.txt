Text: transition in a separated laminar boundary layer .  transition to turbulence was studied in a separated laminarboundary layer on a flat plate 24 in. long and thick .  stepswith a height of to were provided at a distance of 4 totransition was observed through a hot-wire anemometer .  theauthor concludes that transition was always initiated bytollmien-schlichting waves .  two types of transition were observed .  in onetype, bursts suddenly appeared in the wavy flow .  the other typeconsists of amplification, distortion, and breaking up of the waves .which type of transition occurs depends on the value of thefollowing parameter ..  boundary-layer displacement thickness timesstep height times free-stream velocity squared divided bykinematic velocity squared .  the burst type has been observed forvalues of this parameter larger than 4.2 x 10 .  the separatedlaminar boundary layer becomes unstable and develops waves whenthe critical reynolds  number based on boundary-layerdisplacement thickness at the step location exceeds a value of 350 .  someconclusions on the development of separation bubbles on air foilsare drawn from the present studies .
