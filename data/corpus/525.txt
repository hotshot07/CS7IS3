Text: on hypersonic viscous flow over an insulated flat platewith surface mass transfer .  hypersonic viscous flow over an insulated flat plate withsurface mass transfer is studied .  the tangent-wedge approximationis used in the inviscid-flow region, and the integral method isapplied to the treatment of the laminar boundary layer .  the lawof surface mass transfer for the present analysis is derived .  acontinuous transition of the pressure variation is achieved fromthe strong to the weak pressure-interaction region .  first-orderformulas for the induced surface pressure and the skin-frictioncoefficient are obtained for both the strong and weakpressure-interaction regions .  results are compared with those calculatedfrom other analyses .
