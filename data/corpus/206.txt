Text: the applications of the polygon method to the calculationof the compressible subsonic flow round two-dimensionalprofiles .  this paper sets out the method now used by the author ofapplying the polygon method to the calculation of the compressiblesubsonic flow round two-dimensional aerofoils .  tables have beenconstructed which can be used for all aerofoil shapes, putting thepolygon method on the same footing numerically as goldstein'smethod has the advantage over approximation 3 that it can be applied inthe following cases which are beyond the scope of goldstein's method ..conventional aerofoils, (b) the low-speed flow about very thickaerofoils, e.g., in reference 3 it is applied to circular cylinders, (c)the flow about symmetric aerofoils between either straight or constantpressure walls, (d) flow in asymmetric channels,and (e) more difficult problemsof the flow about aerofoils in the presenceof one or two constrainingwalls (to be published) .  a method ofcalculating lift and momentcoefficients, and their rates of changewith incidence (a) is alsogiven in the paper .  as an example the velocity distribution and the rates ofchange of the lift and moment coefficients with a are calculated forthe aerofoil r.a.e.104 at values of m (mach number at infinity) of 0,and 0.7, for various values of the incidence, a .  the velocitydistributions for zero incidence are found to be in fair agreement withthe corresponding experimental results .  the results at incidence arein satisfactory agreement with the experimental results, not for thesame incidence, but for the same lift coefficient .  it is found, forexample, that at m = 0.7 the theory for a = 0.8 agrees bestwith experiment for a = 1.0, when the lift coefficients areapproximately the same .
