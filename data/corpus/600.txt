Text: the calculation of lateral stability derivatives ofslender wings at incidence including fin effectiveness,and correlation with experiment .  comparisons are made betweenlow-speed experimental results andestimates based on attached-flowtheory for the lateral stabilityderivatives of slender wings atincidence, and it is found that the flowseparation has little effect onthe sideslip derivatives .  the reductionin due to part-span anhedralis evaluated, and a semi-empirical formulais derived to account for importantsecond-order terms .  for the rotaryderivatives, an attempt is madeto estimate the effect of the leading edgevortices, but no satisfactoryconclusions have been reached .  the fin contributions tothe derivatives are evaluated on the basisof treating the wing surface asa total reflection plate .  good agreementwith experiment is reached forthe sideslip derivatives, and for thedamping-in-yaw at moderate incidences .sidewash is found to have a largeeffect on the rolling derivatives,and further information on the strengthand position of the leading edgevortices in non-symmetric flow is requiredbefore a complete calculation ofthe sidewash can be given .
