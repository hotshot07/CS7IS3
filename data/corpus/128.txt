Text: effects of free stream vorticity on the behaviour ofa viscous boundary layer .  theoretical investigation is considered of the two-dimensionalsteady flow field at large distance from a finite object set in aviscous incompressible fluid .  study is made of coordinate-typeexpansions for pressure and velocity for large r, uniformly in, forfixed reynolds number, assuming exact boundary conditions atinfinity and regularity of flow with zero net mass flow across asimple curve enclosing the object .  mathematical nature of the distinction between parameter andcoordinate-type expansions is discussed with description of innerand outer expansions and matching techniques .  a feature of the expansion procedure is the introduction of anartificial parameter .  inner and outer expansions are matched withthe aid of known solutions of the navier-stokes equations .analysis requires simple consideration of the heat and laplaceequations without resort to special methods .  paper is worth studying by those interested in asymptoticexpansion procedures .
