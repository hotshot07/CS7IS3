Text: blunt body heat transfer at hypersonic speed and low reynolds numbers .an analytical method for the determination of effect of shock curvatureon heat transfer in the region of the nose has been developed . it isshown that for practical body shape the viscous terms in thenavier-stokes equations are not important in the region of the flow far fromthe wall, and the displacement thickness can be neglected . then theflow can be approximately represented by an inviscid-flow solutionhaving as boundary conditions the body shape, which is not affected bythe reynolds number, and by a boundary-layer type of flow near thewall, having appropriate boundary conditions . this approach permits usto determine the heat transfer in the region of the nose even at verylow reynolds numbers .experimental results are presented . the experimental results agreewith the values given by the analysis .
