Text: on similar solutions for strong blast waves and theirapplication to steady hypersonic flow .  the general solution of the strong blast wave is found in thenewtonian approximation--i.e., neglecting terms of orderthe expressions obtained for the pressure, temperature, density,and velocity profiles are simple .  the results are applied topower-law bodies in hypersonic flow using the equivalenceprinciple .  higher-order approximations for strong blast waves areinvestigated for the cases in which the shock layer is thin .  asimple pressure formula is found, which constitutes animprovement upon the newton-busemann formula, and some of itsapplications are shown .
