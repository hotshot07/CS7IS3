Text: high-speed viscous corner flow .  a boundary-layer integral method analysis is set up forcompressible laminar flow in a symmetric corner with varying angleand streamwise pressure gradient .  it represents an extensionand modification of the constant density analysis of loitsianskiiand bolshakov .  the analysis is applied to the case of constantpressure, constant corner angle, and isothermal surfaces, forwhich the crocco velocity-enthalpy relation holds .  althoughsimplifying assumptions limit the quantitative accuracy outsidethe 60 to 120 angle range, some qualitative trends areprobably correct outside this range .  the limiting cases near 0and 180 are not considered .  favorable agreement between some results obtained by theintegral method and by other methods is demonstrated for theisothermal, constant-density case .  results show an increasingly sharp merger of the outermostisovels of streamwise velocity as the mach number increases .this sharp merging of the outer isovels is increased by increasingcorner angle and by insulation of heating of the surfaces .  withinthe interior of the viscous layer the spreading or contraction ofthe disturbed region of merging is influenced by surfaceheat-transfer conditions .  surface shear and heat flux are decreasedin the disturbed region, and are zero at the apex .  for casescorresponding roughly to the higher mach numbers of widercorner angles, the /specific momentum-area/ exhibits the samedecrease with mach number as its two-dimensional counterpart,whereas the /specific displacement-area,/ a measure ofstream-tube dilation, increases more rapidly with mach number thanthe comparable two-dimensional parameter .
