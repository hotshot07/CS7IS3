Text: approximate indical lift functions for several wings of finite span inincompressible flow as obtained from oscillatory lift coefficients .the unsteady-lift functions for a wing undergoing a sudden change insinking speed have been presented for delta wings having aspect ratiosof 0, 2, and 4 and for rectangular and elliptical wings having aspectratios of 0, 3, and 6 . for the elliptical and rectangular wings thespanwise lift distributions were also presented . these functions werecalculated from the lift coefficients associated with a wing oscillating harmonically in pure translational motion, as obtained from severalsources .the results of these calculations indicate that the normalizedunsteady-lift functions are substantially independent of the shape ofthe plan form for elliptical, rectangular, or moderately tapered wings,. however, for delta wings the increase of lift toward the steady-statevalue is much more rapid than that for the aforementioned wings of thesame aspect ratio . these results also corroborate the results of otherinvestigations in that the rate of growth of lift tends to increase with a decrease in aspect ratio . the shape of the spanwise distributions of the indicial lift seems to be, for all practical purposes, independentof time for rectangular and elliptical wings .
