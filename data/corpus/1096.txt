Text: qualitative measurements of the effective heats ofablation of several materials in supersonic air jetsat stagnation temperature up to 11,000 f.  the effective heats of ablation of a number of materials werederived from tests in supersonic air jets at stagnation temperaturesranging from 2,000 f to 11,000 f .  the materials included the plasticsteflon, nylon, lucite, and polystyrene,. the inorganic salts ammoniumchloride and sodium carbonate, several phenolic resins of varied resincontent and type of reinforcement,. and a melamine-fiber glasslaminate .
