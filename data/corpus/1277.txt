Text: a study of vortex cancellation .  the cancellation of a vortex by means of another concentricvortex of equal strength but opposite spin is investigated .  whensuch a cancellation occurs, there is a recovery of static pressure .the vortices are generated by means of two three-dimensionalairfoils cantilevered from the duct wall, one being situated in thewake of the other .  the airfoils have opposite effective angles ofattack and therefore have trailing vortices of opposite spin, asrequired .  it is demonstrated experimentally that there exists an optimumangle of attack for the second airfoil which cancels the vortexfrom the first airfoil and restores uniform flow downstream ofthe two airfoils .  a theoretical solution of this optimum angle ofattack is presented, and it is found to depend upon the angle ofattack of the first airfoil and upon the geometrical properties ofthe wings .  the pressure recovery accompanying the vortexcancellation is also studied .  theoretical considerations, based onthe model of a vortex filament in the center of a circular tubeshow that a maximum of 62 per cent of the static pressure dropacross the first airfoil can be recovered .  this maximum isimposed, irrespective of skin friction and separation losses, by theirreversibility associated with establishing a vortex field .experimental pressure recoveries of 50 per cent are realized .  perhaps the primary value of the present study is theopportunity it provides to verify certain of the fundamental conceptsof fluid mechanics which are brought into play when the trailingvortex system of a lifting wing is cancelled by a second wing .
