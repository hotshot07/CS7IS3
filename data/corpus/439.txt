Text: a factor affecting transonic leading edge flow separation .  a change in flow pattern that was observed as the free-stream machnumber was increased in the vicinity of 0.8 was described in nacatechnical note 1211 by lindsey, daley, and humphreys .  the flow on theupper surface behind the leading edge of an airfoil at an angle ofattack changed abruptly from detached flow with an extensive region ofseparation to attached supersonic flow terminated by a shock wave .  inthe present paper, the consequences of shock-wave--boundary-layerinteraction are proposed as a factor that may be important in determining theconditions under which the change in flow pattern occurs .  when themach number is high enough, the attached-flow pattern exists becausethen the shock wave is far enough behind the leading edge to keep theinfluence of the high pressure behind the shock wave from extendingthrough the boundary layer to the immediate vicinity of the leading edgeand affecting the flow there .  some experimental evidence in support ofthe importance of shock-wave--boundary-layer interaction is presented .
