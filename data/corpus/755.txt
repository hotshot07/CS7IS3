Text: oscillatory derivative measurements on sting-mountedwind tunnel models method of test and results for pitchand yaw on a cambered ogee wing at mach numbers upto 2. 6.  this report describes a method which has been developed for measuringoscillatory derivatives on sting-mounted models in the 8 ft by 8 ftsupersonic tunnel at r.a.e. bedford .  direct and cross derivatives withrespect to angular displacements and velocities in pitch and yaw havebeen measured satisfactorily, and results are given of tests on acambered ogee wing at six mach numbers from 0.2 to 2.6 .  some testswere made on this model in the course of the preliminary developmentwork in the 13 ft by 9 ft low speed wind tunnel, and results of theseare included .
