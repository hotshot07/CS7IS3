Text: on the plk method and the supersonic blunt-body problem .  detailed analysis of the subsonic and transonic portious of theflow field about either very blunt or asymmetric configurationsrequires successive approximations,. these can be carried out in asystematic fashion only when an appropriate convergentperturbation procedure is available .  the problem of producingsuccessively refined sets of initial conditions for either /direct/or /inverse/ analysis of the flow is formulated in the followingterms ..  given reasonable estimates for shock shape andpressure distribution on the body, can one determine the flow fieldof interest to any desired degree of approximation by aperturbation approach .qm  a procedure to this effect is developed which involvesstretching of coordinates in the spirit of the poincare-lighthill-kuoare transformed along body, shock, and intermediate lines so asto annul perturbations of the local resultant velocity,. (b) for theintegral method the coordinate along the boundary of each stripis shifted so as to control perturbations of the velocity componentthat determines the critical point .  the approach is justified by a study of the equations governingthe direct method, and by consideration of model transonic flowproblems for which closed form solutions are available .  therange of validity of the proposed procedure is assessed bypractical application and comparison with experiment,. results arepresented for a disk set normal to a low-termperature air streamat m = 4.76, and for a highly asymmetric two-dimensionalconfiguration at m = 8 .
