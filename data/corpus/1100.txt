Text: an analytical investigation of ablation .an analytical procedure is described which enables the derivation ofeffective heat of ablation relationships for any type of boundary layerfrom transpiration cooling results . the procedure enables the inclusion of such effects as the ratio of wall temperature to local streamtemperature, surface radiation, and surface combustion .the predicted effective heats of ablation for a three-dimensionallaminar stagnation boundary layer for teflon material were in agreementwith those derived from tests conducted at boundary-layer enthalpypotentials of 800 and approximately 7,000 btu/lb .the predicted equilibrium surface temperatures on nonablating surfacesbehind an ablating material were in agreement with the values derivedfrom tests conducted with inconel cylinders having teflon hemisphericalnose pieces .
