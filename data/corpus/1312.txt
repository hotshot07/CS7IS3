Text: tabulated solutions of the equilibrium gas propertiesbehind the incidents and reflected normal shock-wavein a shock-tube .  tabulated solutions arepresented for the equilibrium gasproperties behind the incident andreflected normal shock-waves in theshock-tube, for nitrogen and oxygen .they cover the range of shock-wavemach numbers up to 12 at intervals ofundisturbed gas pressure between 1 and  the thermodynamic model of thegas used in the calculationsis described in some detail, as is themethod of solving the equations .the limitations of the assumption ofthermodynamic equilibrium are discussedwith regard to shock-tube applications,and the estimated accuracy of thetables is indicated .
