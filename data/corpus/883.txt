Text: correlated fatigue data for aircraft structural joints .  results of fatigue tests carried out at r.a.e. on typical aircraftwing structural joints are correlated to give an indication of generalfatigue behaviour .  the results are plotted in the form of s - log ncurves, and these indicate that the mode of behaviour cannot beattributed to any single factor, such as the type of aluminium alloy,the ultimate tensile strength, or the mean stress of the fatigue cycle .the detailed method of design undoubtedly has a predominant influence onbehaviour, but this quality is not revealed by a broad classificationaccording to the proportion of load transmitted at holes .
