Text: force measurements on square and dodecagonal sectionalcylinders at high reynolds numbers .  results are given of measurements in the compressed air tunnelof the forces on two cylinders, one of square cross-section and theother dodecagonal .  the tests were carried out at various reynoldsnumbers ranging from approximately 0.1 x 10 to 5.5 x 10, based onthe distance between parallel faces .
