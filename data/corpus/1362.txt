Text: non-linear analysis of heated, cambered wings by the matrix forcemethod .various extensions of the matrix force method for complex structureanalysis are presented and illustrated with the objective of expandingits range to handle the problems likely to be encountered in advancedvehicle wing design .  methods are covered in detail for (1) determiningthe change in flexibility that occurs when thermal stresses are present,and also how large these stresses must be to cause buckling, (2)including the non-linear effect of large deflections by an iterativeprocedure, and (3) analyzing a wing that is initially slightly camberedand warped with either or both of the aforementioned effects present .formulas are given for calculating the input matrix terms as are thematrix equations and supporting theoretical discussion .  an exampleillustrates the nature and magnitude of the effects being examined .
