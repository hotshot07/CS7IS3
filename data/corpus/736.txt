Text: the bending of a wedge shaped plate .  a general method of solution is given in this paper forthe problem of bending of a wedge-shaped thin elasticplate with arbitrary boundary conditions on the radial edgesin the case of a single load .  the solution is carried out fora plate with clamped edges and a single load on the bisectorradius of the plate .  stress distribution along the edgesis shown and the behavior of the solution near the cornerpoint is discussed for several opening angles of the plate .
