Text: the hodographic transformation in transonic flow .  the author studies the problem of finding the shape of asymmetrical nozzle with the velocity along the axis (x-axis)specified .  the velocity along each streamline is assumed toincrease steadily .  the singularity at the sonic velocity andto the axis of the nozzle) is first studied in the physicalplane by using a power series in .  in the hodograph plane,the two characteristics of the hodograph differentialequation passing through the sonic point and are linesof branch points .  the region between these lines is aregion of triple-valuedness for the stream function .outside this region is single-valued .  there are alsosingularities at the sonic point and the point corresponding tothe specified condition at the exit of the nozzle .  the authorthen proposes to construct in the hodograph plane byat the exit velocity and (3) a finite sum regular throughout ..sin, where r is the square of the velocityand the are hypergeometric functions .  the a's arefixed by the required approximation to the specified velocitydistribution along the axis .  this solution is single-valued,convergent and represents except a region near the sonicpoint in the nozzle .  for this excluded region, the authorinverts the solution to obtain a power series in for 0 .  thisis shown to be convergent for the region of interest .  thetype of solution considered by the author gives a nozzlehaving an infinitely long supersonic part .
