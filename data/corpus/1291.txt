Text: atmosphere entries with spacecraft lift-drag ratiosmodulated to limit decelerations .  an analysis has been made ofatmosphere entries for which thespacecraft lift-drag ratios weremodulated to limit the maximumdeceleration .  the parts of the drag polarsused during modulation were frommaximum lift coefficient to minimumdrag coefficient .  five drag polarsof different shapes were assumed forthe spacecraft .  the entries coveredwide ranges of initial velocity,initial flight-path angle, initialand maximum lift-drag ratio .two-dimensional trajectory calculations weremade for a nonrotating, sphericalearth with an exponential atmosphere .the results of the analysis indicatefor four of the five drag polars that,relative to the maximum decelerationof an unmodulated entry at maximumlift-drag ratio, the greatest reductionin maximum deceleration obtainableby modulation depends upon a singleparameter .  this parameter is the ratioof the value of the aerodynamicresultant-force coefficient at minimumdrag coefficient to the value atmaximum lift coefficient .  thus, thereduction in maximum decelerationis independent of initial velocity,initial flight-path angle, initialmaximum lift-drag ratio, andthe shape of the drag polar .  forthe fifth drag polar, the reduction inmaximum deceleration was found todepend upon the maximum lift-drag ratio .also, relative to the depth of agiven deceleration-limited corridor, thegreatest increase in corridor depthobtainable by modulation (for four ofthe five drag polars) depends uponthe same ratio of aerodynamicresultant-force coefficients .  the fractionalincrease in corridor depth can beexpressed as an empirically determinedanalytical function of this ratio .
