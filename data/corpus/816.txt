Text: experimental investigation at a mach number of 3. 11of the lift, drag and pitching moment characteristicsof a number of blunt low-fineness-ratio bodies .  a number of blunt bodies having shapes that may be suitable foratmospheric reentry were tested to determine the lift, drag, andpitching-moment characteristics at a mach number of 3.11 and a reynoldsnumber of 6 x 10 based on maximum body diameter of 2 inches .  the results of the tests showed that all the bodies were staticallystable about a point located one-third of the body length from thenose .  the results also showed that high-drag bodies which have a largeportion of their afterbodies negatively sloped (decrease incross-sectional area from nose to base) may have a negative lift-curve slope .this negative slope results from the large negative lift component ofthe axial force obtained with those bodies and the fact that withnegatively sloped afterbodies only small normal forces are developed .
