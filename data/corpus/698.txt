Text: the unsteady lift of a wing of finite aspect ratio .unsteady-lift functions for wings of finite aspect ratio have beencalculated by correcting the aerodynamic inertia and the angle of attack of the infinite wing . the calculations are based on the operationalmethod .the starting lift of the finite wing is found to be only slightly lessthan that of the infinite wing,. whereas the final lift may beconsiderably less . the theory indicates that the initial distribution oflift is similar to the final distribution .curves showing the variation of lift after a sudden unit change in angle of attack, during penetration of a sharpedge gust, and during acontinuous oscillation are given . operational equivalents of thesefunctions have been devised to facilitate the calculation of lift undervarious conditions of motion . as an application of these formulas, thevertical acceleration of a loaded wing caused by penetrating a gust hasbeen calculated .
