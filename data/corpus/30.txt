Text: photo-thermoelastic investigation of transient thermalstresses in a multiweb wing structure .  photothermoelastic experiments were performed on a longmultiweb wing model for which a theoretical analysis is available inthe literature .  the experimental procedures utilized to simulatethe conditions prescribed in the theory are fully described .  correlation of theory and experiment in terms of dimensionlesstemperature, stress, time, and biot number revealed that thetheory predicted values higher than the experimentally observedmaximum thermal stresses at the center of the web .  detailedtemperature measurements in the flange suggested that the majorsource of this discrepancy can be traced to the one-dimensionalheat conduction analysis of the flange employed in the theory .
