Text: some panel-flutter studies using piston theory .  the use of piston theory was recently advocated forsupersonic aeroelastic analyses, including the problem of panel flutter,and this has stimulated the investigation reported here .  linear piston theory is mainly considered, but some effects ofintroducing higher order terms are discussed .  flutter of rectangular simply supported panels and ofelliptically shaped clamped-edge panels is considered, and somejustification is provided for the use of /static/ aerodynamic forcesand the neglect of aerodynamic damping .  hence, it is concludedthat ackeret loading gives more exact results than piston theory .  solution of the flutter equations is made by applying galerkin'smethod to a rayleigh-type analysis using assumed modes ofdeformation .
