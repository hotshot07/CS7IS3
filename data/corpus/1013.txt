Text: principles of creep buckling weight-strength analysis .  published work on creep buckling has implied that failureof columns after a critical time is caused by initial imperfections .such analyses are relatively complex and ultimately leave thechoice of selecting the proper value of the initial imperfection tothe designer .  furthermore, recent test results on creep bucklingof columns have indicated that there is a random and relativelyunimportant effect of small initial imperfections on the criticaltime .  to avoid the difficulties associated with initial imperfections,a formulation of the creep buckling phenomenon in terms ofclassical stability theory is presented .  the theory permits theextension of known solutions for plastic buckling of certain thinplates and shells to creep buckling problems .
