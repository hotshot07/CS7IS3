Text: the effect of entrance velocity on the flow of a rarefiedgas, through a tube .  the flow of a rarefied gas through a circular tube is considered .molecules entering the tube have a mass velocity directed downthe tube, as well as a randomly directed thermal velocity .  it isassumed that the conditions for free-molecule flow hold, and thatmolecules striking the tube wall are reflected diffusely .  themass velocity and tube dimensions are restricted only by thelimitation to free-molecule flow .  the theory is illustrated by anexample of the effect of an entrance tube on the measurement ofpressure and density by a gage placed on a satelite .
