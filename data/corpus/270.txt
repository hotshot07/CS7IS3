Text: on combined free and forced convection laminar magnetohydrodynamicflow and heat transfer in channels with transversemagnetic field .  combined free and forced convective heattransfer in vertical channels has been studied by manyresearchers .  due to the need for engineering designinformation there have been many papers concerningcases of fully developed flow with varying walltemperature .  forced flows in a channel of electricallyconducting fluid with a transverse magnetic fieldhave been studied and the large effects of a magneticfield on the flow pattern have been established .  flows of combined free and forced convection inelectrically conducting fluids in vertical channelswith a transverse magnetic field are expected toattract attention in future engineering applications, forexample, in a magneto-hydrodynamic generator or inplasma studies .  however, except for a report bygershuni and zhukhovitskii (1) concerning aparticular case, no general study has been published .  this paper is a general treatment of fullydeveloped, free and forced convective, laminar,magneto-hydrodynamic flow in a vertical channel with atransverse magnetic field .  it includes combined free andforced convective flows in channels without amagnetic field reported by ostrach (2), tao (3), etc. asspecial cases .  hartmann flow (4) is included in theother limit .
