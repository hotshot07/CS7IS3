Text: experiments at hypersonic speeds on circular conesat incidence .  pressure distribution measurementson five circular cones with totalapex-angles ranging from 25 to 45 degreesare described .  the tests covereda range of angles of incidence from 0 toand 8.60 .  the extent to which variousanalytical and empirical theoriespredict the measured pressures is assessed .
