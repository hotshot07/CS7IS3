Text: nonviscous flow through a pump impeller on a blade-to-blade surface ofrevolution .the nonviscous incompressible flow through a typical pump impeller isanalyzed on a blade-to-blade surface of revolution . solutions areobtained for a variety of inlet conditions including several with prewhirl of the assumed location of the rear stagnation point . comparison ofresults from two approximate methods of analysis showed good agreementfor the zero-angle-of-attack case and reliable indication of theexistence of an eddy on the driving face at a large positive angle ofattack .
