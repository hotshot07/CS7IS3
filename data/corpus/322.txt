Text: on the numerical solution of the blasius problem with three-pointboundary conditions .relates to a technique for approximate determination of the initialparameters . the technique is an application of the asymptoticintegration method introduced by meksyn and has been applied to the computation of the skin friction for shock-generated boundary-layer flow .
