Text: shock-standoff distance for spherical bodies at highmach numbers .  usaf-sponsored development of a simple expression forshock-standoff distance, by consideration of an apropriate specific-heatratio behind the shock .  the theory gives predictions which arealmost as accurate as those of the van dyke and hays methods .
