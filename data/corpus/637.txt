Text: an integral equation relating the general time-dependent lift anddownwash distributions on finite wings in subsonic flow .an integral equation for obtaining the unsteady air forces on finitewings in subsonic compressible flow is presented .  this equationis applicable for any arbitrary time-dependent motion and can beutilized for flexible as well as rigid wings .  the approach involvesthe derivation of an integral equation relating the unknown pressurethe form of the equation is such that it should lend itself readily tomodern high-speed computers for obtaining pressure distributions .special cases of the integral equation are treated for two-dimensionalincompressible flow and are presented in an appendix .
