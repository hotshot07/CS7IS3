Text: two and three-dimensional unsteady lift problems in high speed flight .the problem of transient lift on two- and three-dimensional wings flying at high speeds is discussed as a boundary-value problem for theclassical wave equation . kirchhoffs formula is applied so that theanalysis is reduced, just as in the steady state, to an investigation of sources and doublets . the applications include the evaluation ofindicial lift and pitchingmoment curves for two-dimensional sinking andpitching wings flying at mach numbers equal to 0, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, andtriangular wings in both forward and reversed flow are presented andcompared with the two-dimensional values .
