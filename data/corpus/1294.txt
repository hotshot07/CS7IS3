Text: non-linear shallow shell analysis by the matrix forcemethod .  the matrix force method of redundantstructure analysis is currentlybeing extended by various users to covera number of non-linear problems .one of these is the non-linear analysisof heated cambered wings, such asmight be used in advanced flight vehicles .in this case the approach usedby the present authors is equally applicableto shallow shells, theformulation of the strain-displacement andequilibrium relations being afinite element equivalent to that usedby marguerre .  the solution isobtained by a combined iteration and stepby step procedure utilizing atangent flexibility matrix .  divergencein the calculations indicatesthat the range of stable configurationshas been exceeded .  camberedplates subjected to several loadings aregiven as examples,. for one, anexact solution is available for comparison .  it is believed that the basic conceptsinvolved in this shallowshell analysis can be extended to applyto other, more general shellinstability problems, and that usefulsolutions to the latter areprobably within the capability of present day digital computers .
