Text: on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells .  the deformation and complete stressdistribution are determined foreach of the following edge-loaded thinshells ..  (1) a right circularcylinder, (2) a frustum of a rightcircular cone, and (3) a portion of asphere .  the locations of maximumcircumferential and meridional stressesare also found .  equations aredeveloped for discontinuity shear andmoment at the following junctions ..circular cylinder, (2) axial changeof thickness in a cone, (3) changeof thickness in a portion of a sphere,cylinder and a portion of a sphere,
