Text: note on creep buckling of columns .  a phenomenological relation betweenstress, strain rate, andtemperature is suggested to account for thebehavior of polycrystalline metalsabove the equicohesive temperature .the properties of the metalincluded in the relation are elasticity,linear thermal expansion, andviscosity .  the relation may be integratedunder various conditions toprovide information on creep rates, creeprupture, stress-strain curves,and rapid-heating curves .  it is shownthat for one material - 7075-t6aluminum-alloy sheet - the informationyielded by the relation for thesefour applications agrees reasonablywell with test data .
