Text: second approximation to laminar compressible boundarylayer on flat plate in slip flow .  the first-order solution for the laminar compressible boundary-layerflow over a flat plate at constant wall temperature is given .  theeffect of slip at the wall as well as the interaction between theboundary-layer flow and the outer stream flow are taken intoconsideration .  the solution is obtained explicitly in terms of the known zeroorder, or continuum, solution .  noassumptions regarding the prandtlnumber or viscosity-temperature law need be made .  it is found that thefirst-order solution gives a decrease in heat transfer and, forsupersonic flow, an increase in skin friction .for subsonic flow there is nofirst-order shear effect .  the change in heat transfer is due to slipand the change in friction is due to the interaction of the zero- andfirst-order velocities at the outer edge of the boundary layer .
