Text: magnetohydrodynamic flow past a thin airfoil .  the steady flow of a perfectly conductingmagnetohydrodynamic fluid past a thinnonconducting airfoil is studied with the usual modelin which the fluid variables obey the lundquistequations linearized about a constant unperturbedflow .  /hyperliptic/ flows, in whichhyperbolic and elliptic fields are superimposed,are considered .  results of grad, mccune andresler, and sears and resler are extended andconsidered in detail for the case of an arbitrarilyinclined unperturbed field .  the general solutioncontains four line singularities along thecharacteristics through the ends of the body andhas two arbitrary constants .  by a /generalized kutta-joukowski condition,/ these constantsare fixed so that two of the line singularitiesdisappear .  specifically, it is required that thesolution be locally square integrable .  behaviorof the exponents of the singularities is investigatedby numerical computation and, in limitingcases, analytically .  the singular parts of some flowsare investigated numerically .
