Text: analysis and calculation by integral methods of laminarcompressible boundary layer with heat transfer andwith and without pressure gradient .  a survey of integral methods in laminar-boundary-layeranalysis is first given .  a simple and sufficiently accuratemethod for practical purposes of calculating the propertieslayer in an axial pressure gradient with heat transfer at thewall is then presented .  for flow over a flat plate, the methodis applicable for an arbitrarily prescribed distribution oftemperature along the surface and for any given constantprandtl number close to unity .  for flow in a pressure gradient,the method is based on a prandtl number of unity and a uniformwall temperature .  a simple and accurate method ofdetermining the separation point in a compressible flow with an adversepressure gradient over a surface at a given uniform walltemperature is developed .  the analysis is based on an extension ofthe karman-pohlhausen method to the momentum and thermalenergy equations in conjunction with fourth- and especiallyhigher degree velocity and stagnation-enthalpy profiles .  fromthe equations derived here, conclusions regarding the effect ofpressure gradient, mach number, and wall temperature on theboundary-layer characteristics are derived and illustrated .  inparticular the effects on skin-friction, heat-transfer coefficient,separation point in an adverse pressure gradient, and stabilityof the laminar boundary layer are analyzed .
