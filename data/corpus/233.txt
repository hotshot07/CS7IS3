Text: the theoretical wave drag of some bodies of revolution .  this report investigates the wave drag of bodiesof revolution with pointed or open-nose forebodiesand pointed or truncated afterbodies .  the 'quasi-cylinder'and 'slender-body' theories are reviewed, a reversibilitytheorem is established, and the concept of the interferenceeffect of a forebody on an afterbody is introduced .  the theories are applied to bodies whose profiles are eitherstraight or parabolic arcs, formulae and curves beinggiven for forebody and afterbody drag, and for the interferencedrag .  the results of the two theories are comparedand are seen to agree well in the region of geometries where boththeories are applicable .
