Text: the bending strength of pressurized cylinders .be described here is attributed to the russianinvestigator v. g. galerkin, whose original papers areinaccessible to the present writer .  his knowledgeof the method is derived from a description given ina paper by e. p. grossman .  grossman statesthat the method was given by galerkin in his treatisep. 897), and that applications to oscillation problemswere first made by v. p. lyskov .  it is pointedout by grossman that galerkin's process in applicationsto mechanics leads to the same results aslagrange's principle of virtual work, but employs aspecial co-ordinate system .  the method of galerkin belongs to the same generalclass as those of rayleigh and ritz, for it seeksto obtain an approximate solution of a differentialequation with given boundary conditions by takinga function which satisfies these conditions exactly,and proceeds to specialise the function in such amanner as to secure approximate satisfaction of thedifferential equation .  the selected function isa linear combination of n independent functions, andthe coefficients are determined by a process ofintegration .  the galerkin process can be considered from twopoints of view, (a) simply as a means for theapproximate solution of differential equations, andtreatment of problems concerning the statics anddynamics of elastic and other deformable bodies .these two aspects are treated separately in parts 1and 2 of the paper respectively, and will nowbe briefly discussed .which satisfies the boundary conditions, inthe differential equation be .  since the result should bezero, is the error in the differential equation .then the galerkin process consists in choosing the ncoefficients in the function in such a manner thatn distinct weighted means of the error, taken throughouta certain range of representation, shall allbe zero .as a generalised force, and the multipliers usedto weight the errors are the virtual displacementscorresponding to increments of each of the generalisedco-ordinates in turn .  thus the vanishing of theweighted mean is here interpreted as the vanishingof the virtual work in the appropriate displacement .  the degree of accuracy attaindd can be increasedindefinitely by increasing the number ofindependent functions employed, but this entails a greatincrease of labour .  however, when the functionsare well chosen, an excellent approximation can beobtained by the use of a very small number, as issufficiently shown by the examples included in this paper .
