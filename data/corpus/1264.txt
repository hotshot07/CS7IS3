Text: boundary layer transition and heat transfer in shocktubes .  an experimental study is made of the wall boundary layer in ashock tube operated over a wide range of shock mach numbersand pressure levels in air, including those for which real-gas effectsexist .  transition distances are determined and correlated interms of the transition reynolds number based on acharacteristic length for this boundary layer .  data from independentshock-tube studies are also included in this correlation .  the results indicate a weak dependence of transition reynoldsnumber on shock strength up to moderate values of shock machnumber, followed by a larger stabilizing tendency .  comparisonof these data with transition data obtained in the same mannerin argon indicate that the increased cooling rates are largelyresponsible for the stabilization .  a dependence of transition reynolds number on the unitreynolds number is found at the lower shock strengths .specifically, higher transition reynolds numbers are achieved atlarger unit reynolds numbers .  the phenomenon of transition reversal does not appear withinthe range of the experiments reported .  laminar- and turbulent-flow heat-transfer rates to the wallsof the shock tube are determined experimentally .  the resultsof the heat-transfer measurements substantiate existing theoriesin both the laminar- and turbulent-flow regimes .
