Text: an aerodynamic analysis for flutter in oseen-type viscousflow .  oseen's equations for unsteady flow are employed to obtaina linearized solution based on a discontinuous-wake model .the analysis is employed to estimate the viscous correction tounsteady lift and moment at large reynolds number .  if theasymptotic solution is not too slowly convergent, the correctionis of the order of the ratio of the logarithm of reynolds numberto the reynolds number .  the theory is preliminary in natureas it is limited by the accuracy of oseen's equations and isrestricted to small angle of attack .  however, it also shows thatthe generalized trailing-edge condition for potential flow isreasonable and might predict the essential correction in a realfluid .
