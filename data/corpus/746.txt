Text: aeroelastic problems in connection with high speedflight .  a review is given of developmentsin the field of aeroelasticity during thepast ten years .  the effect of steadily increasingmach number has been two-fold ..  onthe one hand the aerodynamic derivatives havechanged, and in some cases brought newproblems, and on the other hand the design forhigher mach numbers has led to thinneraerofoils and more slender fuselages for whichthe required stiffness is more difficult toprovide .  both these aspects are discussed,and various methods of attack on theproblems are considered .  the relative meritsof stiffness, damping and massbalancefor the prevention of control surface flutter arediscussed .  a brief mention is made ofthe recent problems of damage from jet effluxand of the possible aeroelastic effectsof kinetic heating .
