Text: an experimental study of the turbulen coundary layeron a shock tube wall .  interferometric measurements were made of the density profiles ofan unsteady turbulent boundary layer on the flat wall of a shock tube .the investigation included both subsonic and supersonic flow (machnumbers of 0.50 and 1.77) with no pressure gradient and with heat transferto a cold wall .  velocity profiles and average skin-frictioncoefficients were calculated .  effects on the velocity profile ofsurface roughness and flow length are examined .
