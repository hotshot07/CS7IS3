Text: the calculation of loads on a supersonic weapon inthe steady circling case .  the economy of a design dependson the accuracy with which it is possibleto solve the various structural problemsas this has a direct bearing onstructure weight .  this paper describesthe calculation of the bending momentson a specific weapon for the high-g steadycircling case .  a hybrid method isused to obtain the aerodynamic loads .  the results presented show the effectof a number of parameters, suchas - altitude, weight, acceleration and machnumber - on the magnitude of themaximum bending moment .
