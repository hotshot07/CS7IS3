Text: the effect of adverse pressure gradients on the characteristics ofturbulent boundary layers in supersonic streams .tests were conducted at mach numbers from 2.0 to 3.5 to determinethe thickness and profile shape characteristics of turbulent boundarylayers on two-dimensional and axisymmetric curved-surface modelshaving adverse pressure gradients .  the magnitude of the gradientsrelative to the boundary-layer thickness at the beginning of thegradient was varied by employing models having different radii ofcurvature and by changing the boundary-layer thickness at thebeginning of the gradient .  the overall pressure rise in most cases wasgreater than the value which would cause a turbulent boundary layerto separate if the pressure rise were created by an oblique shock wave .an analytical investigation was also conducted so that the results ofthe experimental investigation could be applied to the prediction ofcases outside the range of the experiments .it is shown that boundary-layer momentum thickness can be predictedfrom the von karman boundary-layer momentum equation, but that measuredvalues of boundary-layer profile shape are in poor agreement withvalues computed from procedures derived by extending conventionalmethods for predicting profile shape in subsonic flow .  a newprocedure for calculating boundary-layer profile shapes, developed in thispaper, is shown to provide a good correlation between experimentaland calculated values of boundary-layer profile shapes in adversepressure gradients created by curved surfaces .  this procedure is basedon the experimental observation that the station at which high-energyfree-stream flow actually mixes into a turbulent boundary layer inan adverse pressure gradient is well downstream of the station atwhich flow would have to mix in order to maintain a flat-plate profile .
