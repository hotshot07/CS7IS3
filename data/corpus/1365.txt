Text: approximate calculation of the laminar boundary layer .  after analyzing a large class of boundary-layervelocity-profiles, the author discovered that the functions l(m) andh(m) for all such cases differ only slightly from each otherover the whole range of positive and negative pressuregradients .  here l, m and h are defined bybeing thevelocity-component in the x direction and u the value of u at theedge of the boundary-layer and and the displacementand momentum thickness, respectively .  based on thisdiscovery, an approximate method is proposed by constructingtwo universal curves l(m) and h(m) for all conceivableboundary-layer flows found in practice .  once these arechosen, karman's momentum-integral can be written in theform, v being the kinematicviscosity coefficient, and can be integrated numerically .  asexamples, both howarth's and hartree'stained is considered good for practical purposes .
