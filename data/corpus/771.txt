Text: on the flow of a compressible fluid past a sphere .  it was shown by raleigh (philos. mag. 32, 1 (1916))that the velocity potential for the subsonic flow of acompressible fluid past a sphere can be expressed as a powerseries in terms of mach's number m (which is the ratio ofthe undisturbed velocity u, divided by the velocity of soundfor the undisturbed flow) .  the equation in question isand boundary conditions are prescribed forraleigh himself computed the first two terms of this series,.the author finds the third term .  he gives some graphsshowing numerical differences between raleigh's and hisapproximation .
