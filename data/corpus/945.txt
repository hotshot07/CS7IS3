Text: method for design of pump impellers using a high speeddigital computer .  a method of designing pump impellersis derived from the equations of motionand continuity for incompressible nonviscousrelative flow .  the flow is assumedto follow a known stream surface (representingblade shape) that extends from hubto shroud .  equations are also derived forapproximate blade-surface velocitiesand pressures .  a detailed numerical procedureand block diagram are given foruse on a digital computer .  a numerical examplethat illustrates limited use ofthe method is presented and further uses areindicated .
