Text: theoretical damping in roll and rolling moment dueto differential wing incidence for slender cruciformwings and wing-body combinations .  a method of analysis based on slender-wing theory is developedto investigate the characteristics in roll of slender cruciform wingsand wing-body combinations .  the method makes use of theconformal mapping processes of classical hydrodynamics whichtransform the region outside a circle and the region outsidean arbitrary arrangement of line segments intersecting at theorigin .  the method of analysis may be utilized to solve otherslender cruciform wing-body problems involving arbitrarilyassigned boundary conditions .  in the present report, the application of the method hasshown ..differential incidence of both pairs of opposite surfaces of thecruciform wing-body combinations are practically independentof the body-diameter-maximum-span ratio up to a value of thisratio of 0.3 .arrangement is only 62 percent greater than that for acorresponding planar wing-body combination .dence of both pairs of the opposing surfaces of the cruciformwing-body arrangement, is only 52 percent greater than thatfor a corresponding planar wing-body combination .unit surface deflection) of the cruciform wing-body arrangementhaving four equally deflected panels is therefore 94 percent ofthe corresponding planar wing-body combination .
