Text: ground measurements of the shock wave noise fromsupersonic bomber airplanes in the altitude range from 30,000to 50,000 feet .  shock-wave ground-pressure measurementshave been made forsupersonic bomber airplanes in the mach numberrange from 1.24 to 1.52, foraltitudes from about 30,000 to 50,000 feet,and for a gross-weight rangefrom about 83,000 to 120,000 pounds .  themeasured overpressures weregenerally higher than would be predictedby the theory which accountsonly for volume effects .  there is thusa suggestion that lift effectson sonic-boom intensity may be significantfor this type of airplanefor the altitude range of the present tests .
