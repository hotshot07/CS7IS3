Text: similar solutions for the compressible boundary layeron a yawed cylinder with transpiration cooling .  heat-transfer and skin-frictionparameters obtained from exactnumerical solutions to the laminarcompressible-boundary-layer equationsfor the infinite cylinder in yaw arepresented .  the chordwise flow inthe transformed plane is of thefalkner-skan type .  solutions are givenfor chordwise stagnation flow withboth a porous and a nonporous wall .the effect of a linearviscosity-temperature relation is compared withthe effect of the sutherlandviscosity-temperature relation at thestagnation line of the cylinder for aprandtl number of 0.7 .  the effects ofpressure gradient, mach number, yawangle, and wall temperature areinvestigated for a linear viscosity-temperaturerelation and a prandtl numberof 1.0 with a nonporous wall .  the results indicate that compressibilityeffects become importantat large mach numbers and yaw angles,with larger percentage effects onthe skin friction than on the heattransfer .  the use of the two differentviscosity relations gives about thesame results except when large changesin temperature occur across the boundarylayer, as for a highly cooledwall .  the present solutions predict thata larger amount of coolant wouldbe required at a given large mach numberand yaw angle than would bepredicted from solutions of the correspondingincompressible-boundary-layerequations .
