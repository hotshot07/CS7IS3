Text: the buckling of sandwich type panels .  fifty-one flat rectangular sandwich-type panels were testedin edgewise compression with the unloaded edges of the panelsrestrained by v-grooves .  the sandwich consisted of papregfaces and a cellular cellulose acetate core .  the thickness of thefaces varied from 0.00675 to 0.02025 in.,. the core, from 0.066to 0.741 in.,. the width of the panel, from 4 to 11 in .  the lengthof the panel was always 10.5 in .  the buckled shape consisted ofa ripple of short wave length across the panel .  it was eithersymmetric, the two faces bulging out symmetrically accordingto sine curves, or skew, the two faces deflecting in the same senseaccording to sine curves having a phase angle of 90 .  a strain energy theory of buckling is presented for both thesymmetric and the skew cases, and the buckling load in thesymmetric case is also calculated by integration of the differentialequation .  the agreement between the theoretic and theexperimental buckling stress is reasonable, that between the predictedand actual buckled shape good .  a simple formula is developedwhich permits a choice of the most suitable core material when themechanical properties of the face material are given .
