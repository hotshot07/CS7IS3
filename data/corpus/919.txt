Text: theoretical studies of unsteady transonic flow . part iii . theoscillating low aspect ratio rectangular wing .by expanding the velocity potential in an asymptotic series, theaerodynamic forces on an oscillating low aspect ratio rectangular wing arecalculated . the approximate theory is valid for small values of ko /osemi-span-to-chord ratio,. k reduced frequency/ and complements anearlier low-aspect-ratio-wing theory by the author valid only forpointed wings like delta wings . the present report gives formulas forthe calculation of generalized forces for any smooth, flexible or rigidmode of oscillation with spanwise symmetry .comparisons with the slender-wing theory show that, except for wings ofvery low aspect ratio, unsteady-flow effects are appreciable even atfairly low reduced frequencies . near the upper limit in ko for theapplicability of the present theory good agreement is obtained with arecent theory for high aspect ratios .
