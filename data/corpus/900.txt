Text: some measurements in the vortex flow generated by asharp leading edge having 65 sweep .  the report is concerned with the vortex flow which ariseswhen separation occurs at a highly swept leading edge .  measurementswere made in the flow over flat plates at 15 incidence each havinga sharp leading edge of 65 sweep .  the pressure and velocitydistributions both along the axis of the vortex and for onecross section of the flow are presented together with a preliminarydiscussion of their significance .
