Text: general instability of a ring stiffened circular cylindricalshell under hydrostatic pressure .  the general instability load of a ring-stiffened, circularcylindrical shell under hydrostatic pressure is determinedby analyzing an equivalent orthotropic shell .  a set ofdifferential equations for the stability of an orthotropicshell is derived and solved for the case of a shell with simpleend supports .  the solution is presented in terms ofparameters of the ring-stiffened, isotropic shell, and arelatively simple expression for the general instability loadis obtained .  some numerical examples and graphs ofresults are presented .  in addition, an energy-methodsolution to the problem is outlined, and the energy anddisplacement functions that could be used in carrying out arayleigh-ritz approximation are indicated .
