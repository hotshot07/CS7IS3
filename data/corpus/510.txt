Text: manoeuvring technique for changing the plane of circularorbits with minimum fuel expenditure .  usaf-supported discussion of the use of an intermediateelliptic orbit for changing the plane of a circular orbit .  values of theperigee and apogee velocities are calculated for the following cases ..the braking impulse supplied by grazing of the atmosphere,. and (3)re-orbit with 90 of the braking impulse supplied in this manner .
