Text: hypersonic viscous flow over a sweat-cooled flat plate .  this paper presents a theoretical analysis of the hypersonicviscous flow over a sweat-cooled flat plate .  the physicalsystem under consideration is the hypersonic laminar boundarylayer over a porous flat plate with homogeneous, normalinjection of a coolant into the external stream .  a heat balance atthe porous surface is made between the heat transferred to thesurface and the heat absorbed by the coolant .  the existenceof similar solutions requires a nonuniform distribution of coolantinjection .  the method of solution consists of the integration ofthree simultaneous first-order equations, the momentum and theenergy integral equations in the boundary layer, and thetangent-wedge approximation in the inviscid layer .  first-orderasymptotic formulas are given in both the strong and the weak pressureinteraction regions for the induced surface pressure, theskin-friction coefficient, and the nusselt number .  numericalresults for three specific cases are presented and discussed .
