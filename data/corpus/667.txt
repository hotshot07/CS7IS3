Text: hypersonic shock layer theory of the stagnation region at low reynoldsnumber .cheng, h.k.hypersonic flow at low reynolds number is studied utilizing theshock-layer concept . the present formulation takes into account the salientfeatures of the transport processes within the shock layer in a mannerconsistent with the shock-layer approximation . the rankine-hugoniotshock relations are modified to include contributions due to heatconduction and viscous effects immediately behind the shock .the specific problem of an axisymmetric stagnation region is treated .the flow regimes for this problem can be classified according to whether or not the transport effects are important immediately behind theshock . in one regime where the ordinary rankine-hugoniot relations hold across the shock, the vorticity-interaction theory based on theboundary-layer approximation is shown to be sufficient . in the otherregime where the rankine-hugoniot relations have to be modified but thecontinuum-flow model applies, an approximate, an analytical solution isobtained . this solution reveals a substantial reduction of thetemperature behind the shock and of the shock stand-off distance in thepresence of strong surface cooling .the present study is intended to provide a knowledge to bridge the gapbetween the free-molecule flow regime and that of the boundary layer via the continuum theory . in this respect, the solution obtained appearsto be satisfactory in that it yields the correct free-molecule limitsfor the skin friction and surface-heat transfer rate .
