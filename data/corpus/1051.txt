Text: the stability of thin-walled unstiffened circular cylindersunder axial compression including the effects of internalpressure .  in the design of high-speed aircraft the importance ofunpressurized and pressurized monocoque cylinders necessitates areliable analysis procedure for the compressive buckling ofcylindrical shells .  analysis by the classical small-deflection theory hasproved inadequate .  recent large-deflection theoreticaltreatments of the problem have shown reasonable correlation withexperiments but require a prior knowledge of the initialimperfections of the cylinder .  developed in this paper is asemiempirical procedure which permits a compressive buckling analysis ofcylindrical shells with a knowledge of the cylinder geometry only .this analysis is achieved by correlating experimental datastatistically with theoretical parameters .  in order to provide data not previously available, an extensiveseries of axial compression tests of pressurized cylinders has beenperformed .  these data, together with all other known test data,are analyzed semiempirically .  in the analysis best-fit curvesare presented using theoretical parameters and shapes of curveswhere applicable .  unpressurized and pressurized cylindercompressive buckling curves are then developed as 90 per centprobability curves from the test data .  in general, thesestatistically defined design curves are significantly lower thanpreviously available design curves .
