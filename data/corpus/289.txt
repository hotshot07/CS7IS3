Text: a theoretical study of the aerodynamics of slendercruciform-wing arrangements and their wakes .  a theoretical study is made of some cruciform-wingarrangements and their wakes by means of slender-body theory .  thebasic ideas of this theory are reviewed and equations aredeveloped for the pressures, loadings, and forces on slendercruciform wings and wing-body combinations .  the rolling-up ofthe vortex sheet behind a slender cruciform wing is consideredat length and a numerical analysis is carried out using 40vortices to calculate the wake shape at various distances behindan equal-span cruciform wing at 45 bank .  analyticalexpressions are developed for the corresponding positions ofthe rolled-up vortex sheets using a 4-vortex approximation tothe wake, and these positions are compared with the positionsof the centroids of vorticity resulting from the numerical analysis .the agreement is found to be remarkably good at all distancesbehind the wing .  photographs of the wake as observed in a water tank arepresented for various distances behind a cruciform wing at 0and 45 bank .  for 45 bank, the distance behind the wingat which the upper two vortices pass between the lower two ismeasured experimentally and is found to agree well with the  the calculation of loads on cruciform tails is considered insome detail by the method of reverse flow, and equations aredeveloped for the tail loads in terms of the vortex positionscalculated in the earlier analyses .
