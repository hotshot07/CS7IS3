Text: on the propagation and structure of the blast wave . part 1.  as a continuation of part 1 (j. phys. soc. japan 8 (1953) 662), thesecond approximation for the propagation and structure of a blastwave is now discussed .  the solution for r=1.4 is obtained by anumerical method, using the results of the first approximation obtainedin part 1 .  by use of this solution, u-r curves, distance-time curvesand the changing feature of distributions of velocity, pressure anddensity behind the shock front are discussed .  further, the approximate solution of the equation is discussed bya refinement of the wkb method due to imai .
