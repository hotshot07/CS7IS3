Text: on calculation of the laminar separation point andresults of certain flows .  paper studies compressible laminar boundary layer in adversepressure gradient .  after mentioning mathematical instabilities inhowarth's and like solutions, authors quote equation from one ofthe references, based on the assumptions that zeroheat transfer and y = 1.4 .  thence authors compute nondimensionaldistances to separation, comparing with solutions by otherworkers .  results are interesting, though reviewer feels rather unhappyabout approximations leading to eq. (4),. more detailedjustifications should have been given .  thus we have the statementber, as ./  surely a fuller discussion of effectsof letting is warranted .  typography in eqs. (2) and (3) is rather confusing and there isa typographical error in heading to table 2 .
