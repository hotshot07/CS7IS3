Text: effect of jet pluming on the static stability of cone-cylinder-flareconfigurations at a mach number of 9. 65 .  the effects of jet pluming onnormal force and pitching moment ofhave been measured at a free-streammach number of 9.65 with reynoldsnumbers based on model length of 500,000to 600,000 .  geometric variablesincluded nose bluntness, flare half-angle,and nozzle geometry and exit displacement .two test nozzles with designmach numbers of 3.74 and 4.60 were operatedwith compressed air tosimulate the initial jet-boundary shape of aparticular solid-propellantrocket motor operating between altitudesof 165,000 and 215,000 feet .the ratio of the jet pressure to free-streamstatic pressure varied froma jet-off condition to approximately 1,300for the nozzle with design machnumber of 3.74, and from a jet-off conditionto approximately 280 for thenozzle with design mach number of 4.60 .the angle-of-attack range wasfrom 0 to approximately 6 .  the results indicate that as thejet-pressure ratio was increasedthe size of the jet plume increased,and as a result the model staticstability was decreased .  increasingthe angle of attack resulted in areduction in static instability duringthe jet-on condition .  increasingnose bluntness resulted in a more forwardmovement of the center ofpressure when jet-plume interference was notpresent and a rearward movementin the center of pressure when jetinterference was present .  increasingthe nozzle-area expansion ratio anddisplacing the nozzle exit downstreamof the flare base resulted in a morerearward location of the center ofpressure .
