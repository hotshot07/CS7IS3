Text: base pressure at subsonic speeds in the presence ofa supersonic jet .  this paper presents the results of an experimental investigationinto the effect of supersonic jets upon the base pressure of a bluffcylinder in a uniform subsonic flow .  the ratio of jet diameter to basediameter was 0.1875 .  jet stagnation pressures giving slight under-expansion of the jetcause an increase in the base pressure but for larger jet stagnationpressures the base pressure is again reduced .  a simple theory, based on a momentum integral, shows the dependenceof the base drag upon the jet and free stream speeds and upon thedimensions of the jet and the base .
