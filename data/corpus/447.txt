Text: motion of thin bodies in a highly rarefied plasma .  magnetic effects are considered negligible,and the velocity of the body is in a range between theelectron and positive ion thermal speeds .the self-consistent field approach is used in which theelectron distribution is assumed to be maxwellian,while the positive ion distribution function is givenby the /collision-free/ boltzmann equation .it is assumed that the ion reflection at the body surfaceis specular, and the body is sufficiently thin sothat the ion distribution function is a small perturbationof a maxwellian distribution .  the solution forthe simple case of a dielectric body with a given surfacecharge, as well as some general properties tobe expected for a conducting body are given .
