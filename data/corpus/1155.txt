Text: some experimental investigations on the influence of wall boundarylayers upon wind tunnel measurements at high subsonic speeds .pressure distribution measurements and drag determination by means ofbalance measurements have been carried out for a number of models athigh subsonic velocity in wind tunnels, where the boundary layer of thewalls has been varied . within the investigated range it appeared that a thickening of the boundary layer reduced the disturbing influence ofthe walls, which also caused an increase of the choking mach number .the phenomenon described should be of a certain importance from thepoint of view of wind tunnel technique, since it is possible to increase the choking velocity for a given model by means of thickening theboundary layer .
