Text: the buckling of cylindrical shells under longitudinally varying loads .two problems illustrating the effect of nonuniformity of loadingon the buckling characteristics of circular cylinders areinvestigated .  the first problem deals with the effect oflinearly varying axial compressive stress, such as would beproduced by the weight of the propellant in a solid-propellantengine case .  the results indicate that the ratio of the maximumcritical compressive stress induced by the shear load to thecritical uniform compressive stress varies from 1.9 forthe curvature parameter z equal to 1.6 as zbecomes infinite .  in particular, the increase in stress isless than 20 per sq. ft. for z greater than 100 .the stability of thin cylinders loaded by lateral externalpressure varying linearly in the longitudinal direction is alsoinvestigated .  the results indicate that for z greater than 100,the buckling coefficients are proportional to squareroot z .
