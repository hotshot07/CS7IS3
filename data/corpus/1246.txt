Text: solution of subsonic nonplanar lifting surface problemsby means of high-speed digital computers .  the method proposed in this paper is based on an approximatesolution of the integral equation which represents the potentialflow about a finite wing, with no restrictions beyond thosenecessary for linearization .  after assuming the usual seriesrepresentation of the wing surface vorticity distribution, the solutionis achieved by approximating portions of the kernels of thetransformed integral equation by single and double fourier series andperforming termwise integrations analytically .  this is followedby the routine inversion of the aerodynamic influence coefficientmatrix, after satisfying appropriate boundary conditions atselected control points .  in this procedure the number of controlpoint used is limited only by the storage capacity of thecomputer .  control points may be located so as to cover the entirewing surface, with due regard to certain physical requirements,permitting the accurate representation of complicated meansurface shapes .  an evaluation of the proposed method is included .comparisons with other theoretical methods and electrical analogy tankresults are used to substantiate the accuracy of the proposedmethod when applied to plane wings .  a final evaluationinvolves a comparison of calculated surface pressure distributionwith wind-tunnel measurements on a swept, tapered wing witha cambered and twisted mean surface .  the agreement evidencedin the latter comparison has the same order of overall accuracy assimilar comparisons on plane wing planforms .  in either case,the results given by the proposed method are within the accuracyrequirements for most aircraft design studies .
