Text: aerodynamic forces, moments and stability derivativesfor slender bodies of general cross section .  the problem of determining the totalforces, moments, and stabilityderivatives for a slender body performingslow maneuvers in a compressiblefluid is treated within the assumptionsof slender-body theory .  generalexpressions for the total forces (exceptdrag) and moments are developedin terms of the geometry and motions ofthe airplane, and formulas forthe stability derivatives are derived interms of the mapping functionsof the cross sections .  all components of the motion aretreated simultaneously and secondderivatives as well as first are obtained,with respect to both themotion components and their time rates ofchange .  coupling of thelongitudinal and lateral motions is thusautomatically included .  a number ofgeneral relationships among the variousstability derivatives are foundwhich are independent of the configuration,so that, at most, only 35of a total of 325 first and secondderivatives need be calculateddirectly .  calculations of stabilityderivatives are carried out for twotriangular wings with camber and thickness,one with a blunt trailingedge, and for two wing-body combinations, one having a plane wing andvertical fin .  the influence on the stabilityderivatives of the squared terms inthe pressure relation is demonstrated,and the apparent mass concept asapplied to slender-body theory is discussedat some length in the lightof the present analysis .  it is shown thatthe stability derivatives canbe calculated by apparent mass although thegeneral expressions for thetotal forces and moments involve additional terms .
