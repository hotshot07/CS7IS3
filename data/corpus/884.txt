Text: the estimation of fatigue damage on structural elements .  a method is presented for the estimation of fatigue damage toaircraft structural elements .  the gust spectrum to which the aircraftis subjected is analysed in terms of infinitesimal loading intervals .gust data supplied by j. taylor for flying below 15,000 ft are used tostudy fatigue damage in a number of aircraft structural joints and onewhole structure .
