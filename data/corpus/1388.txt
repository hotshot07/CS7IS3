Text: a process for the step-by-step integration of differentialequations in an automatic digital computing machine .  it is advantageous in automaticcomputers to employ methods of integrationwhich do not require preceding function valuesto be known .  from a general theory given bykutta, one such process is chosen givingfourth-order accuracy and requiring the minimumnumber of storage registers .  it is developed intoa form which gives the highest attainableaccuracy and can be carried out by comparativelyfew instructions .  the errors are studied anda simple example is given .
