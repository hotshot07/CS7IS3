Text: some structural and aerelastic considerations of highspeed flight .  the dominating factors in structural design of high-speedaircraft are thermal and aeroelastic in origin .  the subjectmatter is concerned largely with a discussion of these factors andtheir interrelation with one another .  a summary is presentedof some of the analytical and experimental tools available toaeronautical engineers to meet the demands of high-speed flightupon aircraft structures .  the state of the art with respect toheat transfer from the boundary layer into the structure, modesof failure under combined load as well as thermal inputs andacrothermoelasticity is discussed .  methods of attacking andalleviating structural and aeroelastic problems of high-speedflight are summarized .  finally, some avenues of fundamentalresearch are suggested .
