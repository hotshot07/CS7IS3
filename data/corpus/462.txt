Text: photo-thermoelasticity .  this paper summarizes the optical and physicalproperties of the photoelastic model material paraplex p-43 overthe temperature range from room temperature to -40 f .descriptions are presented of techniques and equipmentdeveloped to obtain the modulus of elasticity, the materialfringe value, and the thermal-expansion coefficient as afunction of temperature .  experimental investigationswere conducted into the plane-stress problems of a diskcontracting upon an elastic inclusion and the transientthermal-stress field produced by a temperature differentialsuddenly applied to the upper edge of a long beam .  thedata are correlated with theory using the materialproperties obtained in the calibration phase .  also included arephotographic results of an exploratory investigation of thethermal-shock phenomenon produced by the suddenapplication of a temperature differential upon plastic beamsof various length-depth ratios .
