Text: cumulative damage in fatigue .  the phenomenon of cumulative damage under repeatedloads was assumed to be related to the net work absorbedby a specimen .  the number of loading cycles appliedexpressed as a percentage of the number to failure at agiven stress level would be the proportion of useful lifeexpended .  when the total damage, as defined by thisconcept, reached 100 per cent, the fatigue specimen shouldfail .  experimental verification of this concept for analuminum alloy, using different types of specimens,various stress ratios, and various combinations of loadingcycles is presented .  these data are also analyzed toprovide information on different stress ratios when an s-ncurve for any one ratio is known .  results of a sampleanalysis based on experiments are given .  it isconcluded that a simple and conservative analysis is possibleusing the concept of cumulative fatigue damage .
