Text: on source and vortex distributions in the linearisedtheory of steady supersonic flow .  the hyperbolic character of the differentialequation satisfied by the velocitypotential in linearized supersonic flow entailsthe presence of fractional infinitiesin the fundamental solutions of the equation .difficulties arising from this fact canbe overcome by the introduction of hadamard'sfinite part of an infinite integral .together with the definition of certain counterpartsof the familiar vector operatorsthis leads to a natural development of the analogybetween incompressible flowand linearized supersonic flow .  in particular, formulaeare derived for the field offlow due to an arbitrary distribution of supersonicsources and vortices .  applications to aerofoil theory, including thecalculation of the downwash in thewake of an aerofoil, are given in a separate report (ref. 9) .
