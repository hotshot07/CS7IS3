Text: low frequency fatigue of nimonic 90 . low frequencyfatigue - a rheological approach .an alloy of nimonic 90 type has been tested under cyclic loads attemperatures of 800 deg., 850 deg. and 900 deg. cent .  graham'sdescriptive theory of deformation has been developed in detail for thetests reported here, and shown to provide a satisfactory description ofthe experimental results .  the variation of cumulative strain withnumber of cycles can be described by the sum of powers of cycle number,n, n, n, and n .  there is qualitative agreement between the observedand the calculated stress-strain loops .  the effect of variation ofmaximum stress per cycle can be described by the sum of power terms withsimple exponents .  within the scatter of observation, the total time tofracture is independent of the frequency .
