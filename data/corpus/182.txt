Text: effect of roughness on transition in supersonic flow .  further experiments carried out in the 12-inch supersonic wind tunnelof the jet propulsion laboratory ofthe california institute of technologyto investigate the effect ofthree-dimensional roughness elements (spheres)on boundary-layer transition on a 10transfer are reported herein .  thelocal mach number for these tests wasminimum (effective) size of triprequired to bring transition to itslowest reynolds number varies as theone-fourth power of the distance fromthe apex of the cone to the trip .use of available data at other machnumbers indicates that the machnumber influence for effective trippingis taken into account by thesimple expression .
