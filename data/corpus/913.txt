Text: vibrations of beams on many supports .  the natural frequencies of a continuousbeam resting on an arbitrarynumber of uniformly spaced supports aredetermined from a difference equationformulation .  these frequencies fall inperiodically spaced groups that areseparated by spectral gaps of widthsequal to approximately half the intervalbetween the natural frequencies of asingle beam on a square root frequencyscale .  these groups tend to uniformspectra as the number of supports tendsto infinity, but the gaps remain, givinga band-pass character to the entirespectrum .  wave propagation along aninfinite, periodically supported beamis discussed and the phase and groupvelocities evaluated as functions offrequency .
