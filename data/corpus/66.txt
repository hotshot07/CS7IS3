Text: some effects of joint conductivity on the temperatureand thermal stresses in aerodynamically heated skin-stiffenercombinations .  temperatures and thermal stresses in typical skin-stiffenercombinations of winglike structures subjected to aerodynamic heating havebeen obtained with the aid of an electronic differential analyzer .variations were made in an aerodynamicheat-transfer parameter, in a jointconductivity parameter, and in the ratioof skin width to skin thickness .the results, which are presented in nondimensional form, indicate thatdecreasing the joint conductivity parameter lowers both the interiorand the average temperature ratios, increases the peak thermal stressratios in the skin, and may considerably increase the peak stiffenerstress ratios,. increasing the aerodynamic heat-transfer parameterdecreases the interior and average temperature ratios, increases thepeak skin stress ratios somewhat,but greatly increases the peakstiffener stress ratios,. and increasing the ratio of skin width to skinthickness produces only moderate decreases in the peak skin stressratios while moderately increasing the peak stiffener stress ratios .
