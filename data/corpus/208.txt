Text: the hall effect in the viscous flow of ionized gasbetween parallel plates under transverse magnetic field .  the electrical conductivity of an ionizedgas is anisotropic in thepresence of magnetic field (hall effect) .the conductivity is expressed bya tensor in the same form for both fullyand partially ionized gases .  bythe use of modified ohm's law andconventional magnetohydrodynamicalequations the incompressible viscousflow between parallel plates underthe transverse magnetic field is analyzedand an exact solution is obtainedwhen the magnetic reynolds numberis small .  the numerical resultsreveal a remarkable effect of anisotropyof conductivity .  the accelerationand deceleration of viscous ionizedgas under combined electric andmagnetic fields are also calculated .
