Text: the contraction of satellite orbits under the influence of air dragpart i . with spherically symmetrical atmosphere .the effect of air drag on satellite orbits of small eccentricity e/0.2/is studied analytically by a perturbation method, on the assumption that the atmosphere is spherically symmetrical . equations are derived which show/1/how orbital period and perigee distance vary with eccentricityas the orbit contracts, and/2/how each of these quantities varies withtime . the equations of type/1/are nearly independent of the oblatenessof the atmosphere . in all the equations, terms of order e and higherare usually neglected . the results are also presented graphically, in a manner designed for practical use .the theory is to be extended to an oblate atmosphere in part ii, andwill later be compared with observation .
