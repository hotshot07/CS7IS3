Text: force-test investigation of the stability and controlcharacteristics of a scale model of a tilt-wing verticaltake-off and landing aircraft .  a wind-tunnel investigation hasbeen made to determine theaerodynamic characteristics of a scalemodel of a tilt-wing vertical-take-off-and-landing aircraft .  the modelhad two 3-blade single-rotationpropellers with hinged (flapping)blades mounted on the wing, whichcould be tilted from an incidenceof 4 for forward flight to 86 forhovering flight .  the investigation includedmeasurements of both the longitudinaland lateral stability and controlcharacteristics in both the normalforward flight and the transitionranges .  tests in the forward-flightcondition were made for several valuesof thrust coefficient, and testsin the transition condition were madeat several values of wing incidencewith the power varied to cover a rangeof flight conditions fromforward-acceleration (or climb) conditions todeceleration (or descent) conditionsthe control effectiveness of theall-movable horizontal tail, the aileronsand the differential propeller pitchcontrol was also determined .  thedata are presented without analysis .
