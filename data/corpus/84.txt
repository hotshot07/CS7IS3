Text: experimental investigation of the downstream influenceof stagnation point mass transfer .  this report presents the results of an experimentalinvestigation of the downstream influence of localized mass transfer in thestagnation region of a blunt body under hypersonic flowconditions .  the coolant is injected through a porous plug coaxialwith the centerline of symmetry of the model .  the tests werecarried out in a wind tunnel with a mach number of 6.0,stagnation temperatures of approximately 1,600 r., and a stagnationpressure of approximately 600 psia .  four different gases wereinjected over a range of mass flows .  the heat transfer on theimpermeable section was measured under isothermal wallconditions,. for the higher rates of mass flow, adiabatic surfacetemperatures were also determined .  the theoretical analysis of theboundary-layer flow is investigated in order to establish thesimilarity parameters for the flow system .  these parameters permitthe extrapolation of the test results to other flow conditions,provided that laminar flow prevails .  helium is found to be themost efficacious coolant .
