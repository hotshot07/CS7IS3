Text: experimental investigation of the aerodynamics of awing in a slipstream .  an experimental study of a wing in a propeller slipstream wasmade in order to determine the spanwise distribution of the liftincrease due to slipstream at different angles of attack of the wingand at different free stream to slipstream velocity ratios .  theresults were intended in part as an evaluation basis for differenttheoretical treatments of this problem .  the comparative span loading curves, together withsupporting evidence, showed that a substantial part of the lift incrementproduced by the slipstream was due to a /destalling/ orboundary-layer-control effect .  the integrated remaining liftincrement, after subtracting this destalling lift, was found to agreewell with a potential flow theory .  an empirical evaluation of the destalling effects was made forthe specific configuration of the experiment .
