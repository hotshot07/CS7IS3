Text: the flow field over blunted flat plates and its effecton turbulent boundary growth and heat transfer at amach number of 4. 7.  surface pressures, impact andstatic pressure distributions in theflow field over the plate, and localheating rates were measured on aflat plate with various leading-edgediameters .  the tests were conductedat a mach number of 4.7 and afree-stream reynolds number of 3.8x10 perfoot .  it was found that the shape ofthe shock wave indicated the existenceof an outward deflection of the flowover the plate .  the flow deflectioncaused an outward deflection of theshock-wave asymptote of approximatelythe shock-wave angle calculatedincluding boundary-layer growth .  themach number distributions in theshear layer evaluated from pitot andstatic pressure surveys agreed withpredictions based on shock-wave shape .the predicted turbulentheat-transfer coefficients for the bluntedflat plates agreed with themeasured heat-transfer coefficients .  acomparison between the measuredheat-transfer coefficients for the bluntedflat plates and the calculatedcoefficients for a sharp leading-edgedplate indicated that thecoefficients were highest near the leadingedge of the most blunted plate .  themeasured heat-transfer coefficientsdropped to approximately 80 percentof the sharp-plate values at aconsiderable distance from the leadingedge for all of the blunted flat plates .
