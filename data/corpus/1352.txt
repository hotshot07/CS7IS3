Text: aerodynamic investigation of a parabolic body of revolutionat mach number of 1. 92 and some effects of an annularsupersonic jet exhausting from the base .  an aerodynamic investigationof a parabolic body of revolution wasconducted at a mach number of 1.92with and without an annular supersonicjet exhausting from the base .measurements with the jet inoperative weremade of lift, drag, pitching moment,radial and longitudinal pressuredistributions, and base pressures .with the jet in operation,measurements were made of the pressuresover the rear of the body with theprimary variables being angle of attack,ratio of jet velocity tofreestream velocity, and ratio of jetpressure to stream pressure .  the results with the jet inoperativeshowed that the radialpressures over the body varied appreciablyfrom the distribution generallyemployed in most approximate theories .the linearized solutions for lift,pitching moment, and center of pressuregave relatively poor predictionsof the experimental results .  an analysisof several theoretical methodsfor calculating pressure distribution andwave drag showed that somemethods gave results in considerabledisagreement with experimental values .  maximum effects of the jet wereobtained at the lower ratio of jetvelocity to stream velocity and thehighest ratio of jet pressure tostream pressure .  these effects amountedto a slight decrease infore-drag, a reduction in lift, and a shiftof center of pressure in adestabilizing direction .
