Text: aerodynamic characteristics of a circular cylinderat mach number of 6. 86 and angles of attack up to90 .  pressure-distribution and forcetests of a circular cylinder havebeen made in the langley 11-inchhypersonic tunnel at a mach number ofbased on diameter, and angles ofattack up to 90 .  the results arecompared with the hypersonicapproximation of grimminger, williams, andyoung and with a simple modificationof the newtonian flow theory .  thecomparison of experimental resultsshows that either theory gives adequategeneral aerodynamiccharacteristics but that the modified newtoniantheory gives a more accurateprediction of the pressure distribution .the calculated crossflow dragcoefficients plotted as a functionof crossflow mach number were foundto be in reasonable agreement withsimilar results obtained from otherinvestigations at lower supersonicmach numbers .  comparison of theresults of this investigation withdata obtained at a lower mach numberindicates that the drag coefficientof a cylinder normal to the flow isrelatively constant for mach numbersabove about 4 .
