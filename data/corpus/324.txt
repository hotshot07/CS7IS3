Text: vorticity effect on the stagnation point flow of a viscousincompressible fluid .the effect of vorticity on axisymmetric stagnation point boundary layercalculations is investigated by calculating a perturbation to thestagnation point flow . the shear caused by the vorticity effect isfound to be surprisingly large,.the slope of the shear curve /at zerovorticity/ as calculated by kemp agrees perfectly with the value deduced in this note .
