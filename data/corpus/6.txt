Text: one-dimensional transient heat flow in a multilayerslab .  in a recent contribution to the readers'forum wassermann gave analyticsolutions for the temperature in a doublelayer slab, with a triangular heatrate input at one face, insulated at the other,and with no thermal resistanceat the interface .  his solutions were for thethree particular cases..i propose here to give the general solutionto this problem, to indicatebriefly how it is obtained using the method ofreference 2, and to point outthat the solutions given by wassermann areincomplete for times longerthan the duration of the heat input .
