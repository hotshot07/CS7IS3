Text: investigation of the effects of ground proximity andpropeller position on the effectiveness of a wing withlarge chord slotted flaps in redirecting propellerslipstream downward for vertical take-off .  an investigation of the effectsof ground proximity and propellerposition on the effectiveness of awing equipped with large-chord slottedflaps in redirecting the slipstreamsfrom large-diameter propellersdownward for vertical take-off has beenconducted in a static-thrustfacility at the langley aeronauticallaboratory .  the results indicate that, withthe propeller thrust axis on thewing chord plane, both the angle throughwhich the slipstream isdeflected and the ratio of resultant forceto thrust are reduced as the groundis approached .  at positions nearestthe ground some of the loss inresultant force is regained .  loweringthe thrust axis below the wingchord plane reduces the adverse effectsof the ground and also reducesthe large diving moments associated withthe slotted-flap arrangement .the static-thrust efficiency of thepropellers is slightly reduced bythe ground effect .
