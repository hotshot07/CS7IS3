Text: variational and lagrangian thermodynamics of thermalconvection-fundamental shortcomings of the heat transfercoefficient .  extension of previous analyses, indicating the possibility ofextending the thermodynamics of irreversible processes to systemswhich are not in the vicinity of an equilibrium state and for whichonsager's relations are not verified .  this involves generalizationsbeyond the narrow field of heat transfer and to principles of widerrange than those of current nonequilibrium thermodynamics .
