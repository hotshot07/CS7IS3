Text: the stagnation point boundary layer in the presenceof an applied magnetic field .  similarity equations for axisymmetric compressible flow areobtained, assuming that the magnetic field is uniform, normal to thesurface, and unaffected by the flow, and that the conductivityvaries as the nth power of the enthalpy .  numerical solutions aregiven for a number of values of n and of the field strength, and areused to modify the estimates of heat-transfer made by the authorusing inviscid theory (title source 26, 536-537, 1959) .
