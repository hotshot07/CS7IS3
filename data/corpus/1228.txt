Text: leading-edge separation of laminar boundary layersin supersonic flow .  a brief description of the flow field is given for the interactionof shock wave and laminar boundary layer on a compressioncorner in supersonic flow .  a special sub-case--that ofleading-edge laminar separation--is analyzed by extension of chapman'slaminar mixing-layer theory .  results are tabulated for rangesof mach number, and compression-corner angle .a limited region of possible leading-edge laminarseparation with an attached leading-edge shock (or in certaincases an expansion) followed by a second shock due to thereattachment flow is found to exist .  comparison with existingexperimental data is found to be satisfactory in several cases .
