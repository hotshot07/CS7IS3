Text: the supersonic axial flow compressor .  an investigation has been made to explore the possibilities ofaxial-flow compressors operating with supersonic velocities intothe blade rows .  preliminary calculations showed that veryhigh pressure ratios across a stage, together with somewhatincreased mass flows, were apparently possible withcompressors which decelerated air through the speed of sound in theirblading .  the first phase of this investigation, which has beenreported in naca acr l5d20, was the development of efficientsupersonic diffusers to decelerate air through the speed of sound .the present report is largely a general discussion of some of theessential aerodynamics of single-stage supersonic axial-flowcompressors .  in the supersonic flow about isolated bodies,large energy losses usually occur due to wave systems whichextend far from the bodies .  supersonic flow entering a cascadeis considered and, in this case, the possibility of entirelyeliminating this extended wave system is demonstrated,. thus, noreason for supersonic compressors to be necessarily inefficientis apparent .  the conditions that occur as the flow through thecompressor is being started are discussed and a hypothesis asto the type of transonic flow which will be encountered isproposed .  as an approach to the study of supersonic compressors, threepossible velocity diagrams are discussed briefly .  because ofthe encouraging results of this study, an experimentalsingle-stage supersonic compressor has been constructed and tested infreon-12 .  in this compressor, air decelerates through thespeed of sound in the rotor blading and enters the stators atsubsonic speeds .  a pressure ratio of about 1.8 at an efficiencyof about 80 percent has been obtained .
