Text: compressible boundary layers on bodies of revolution .  in a former paper (1) it has been shown that thebehaviour of the laminar boundary layer on a body of revolution canbe described mathematically by the same equations which are alsoapplied to the processes in the laminar boundary layer in thetwo-dimensional flow along a body contour, the form of which isdetermined by the shape of the body of revolution .  a simplerelation exists between the two-dimensional boundary layers andthe axially symmetrical ones .  the flow had been assumed to beincompressible .  in this report it shall be shown that thisrelation is still valid when the compressibility is taken intoconsideration .  the distribution of velocity as well as that oftemperature in the laminar boundary layer of a body of revolutioncan be calculated by solving the corresponding problem for thetwo-dimensional flow around a suitable contour .  the method ismade clear by the example of the supersonic flow towards a conetip,. this example has already been treated by another methodby hantzsche and wendt (2) .
