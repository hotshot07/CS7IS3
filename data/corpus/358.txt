Text: on the model of the free shock separation, turbulentboundary layer .  by free shock-separated boundary layers, one means that type ofseparation where the flow downstream of the separation region is free toadjust to any direction that may result from the shock-boundary-layerinteraction process .  a detailed model of the free shock-separatedturbulent boundary layer is postulated, and the pressure rise followingfrom this model is estimated and compared with experiments .  theresults are applied to the prediction of separation in an overexpandednozzle .
