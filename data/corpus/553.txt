Text: ablation of glassy materials around blunt bodies ofrevolution .  the steady-state equations of motion for athin layer of an incompressible glassy material on thesurface of an ablating and radiating bluntbody are reduced to a first-order ordinary differentialequation which is integrated numerically .this solution is coupled with the solution of the airboundary layer for both laminar and turbulentheat transfer with or without mass vaporization ofthe ablating material .  the distribution of theeffective energy of ablation around the body is thusobtained for a cone cylinder with a hemisphericalcap that re-enters the atmosphere at hypersonicflight speeds, and has quartz as the ablatingmaterial .  it is found that the ablation process fromturbulent heating is more efficient than fromthe laminar case because of increased vaporization .this solution of the equations of motion at thestagnation point has been verified by are wind tunnelexperiments .  the present state of developmentof the are wind tunnel does not permit its use forexperimental investigations of ablation aroundblunt bodies under turbulent heating .
