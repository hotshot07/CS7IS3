Text: skin friction in the laminar boundary layer in compressibleflow .  from an analysis of the work ofcrocco and others, semi-empirical formulaeare derived for the skin friction on aflat plate at zero incidence with a laminarboundary layer .  these formulae arefor the general case of heat transfer, andwhen there is no heat transfer .  the problem of heat transfer andthe effect of radiation are discussed in thelight of these formulae .  the secondformula is then utilised in the development ofan approximate method for solving themomentum equation of the boundary layeron a cylinder without heat transfer .the method indicates that with increase ofmach number there is a marked forwardmovement of separation from a flat platein the presence of a constant adverse velocity gradient .
