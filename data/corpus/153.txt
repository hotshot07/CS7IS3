Text: on the steady motion of viscous, incompressible fluids,with particular reference to a variation principle .  except in exceptional cases, it is not possible to represent themotion of a viscous incompressible liquid by means of a variationprinciple, but all cases of such motion that have yet been discoveredbelong to this class of /exceptional cases ./  the appropriate functionsare given .
