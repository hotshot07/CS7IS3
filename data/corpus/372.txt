Text: an experimental investigation of flow about simpleblunt bodies at a nominal mach number of 5. 8.  an experimental investigation wasconducted in the galcit hypersonicwind tunnel to determine flow characteristicsfor a series of blunt bodies at anominal mach number of 5.8 and free-streamreynolds numbers per in. ofmeasured values for the pressurecoefficient distributions are compared witha modified newtonianexpression .  the agreement is very good for thethree-dimensional bodies and isfair for the circular cylinder transverse to thefree-stream flow direction .  acomplete report of the investigation is given ina galcit hypersonic windtunnel memorandum .
