Text: the occurrence and development of boundary layer separations at highincidences and high speeds .this note describes the manner in which the onset of the effects ofboundary-layer separation varies with mach number for two-dimensionalaerofoils, and discusses the influence of section shape as far as it isknown . a brief qualitative description is given of the mechanismunderlying the development of the separated flow and its effects,followed by a discussion of some of the ways in which this is likely todiffer for swept-back wings at high speeds . finally, the need isemphasized for continued work in a broadening field .
