Text: effects of stage characteristics and matching on axial flow compressorperformance .the use of stage characteristics obtained from test data in theperformance analysis and development of an axial-flow compressor is describedrelative stage matching as shown by an idealized example and also bytest experience . factors governing major performance parameters arediscussed and certain development problems and possible solutions arereviewed .
