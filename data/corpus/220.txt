Text: a general purpose analogue correlator for the analysis ofrandom noise signals .a large proportion of the current research programme of thedepartment of aeronautics and astronautics is concerned with thestudy of jet noise and boundary layer pressure fluctuations andtheir effect on aircraft structures .  early in the work it wasdecided that for a complete description of the random processesinvolved it would be necessary in the experimental programme tomake correlation measurements in addition to the more standardspectrum and amplitude distribution measurements .  it was alsofelt that it would be desirable from the university point of viewto construct a general purpose correlator which could later beused on other types of work .  to this end it was decided to givethe correlator a wider bandwidth than might strictly have beennecessary for the problems on hand .  subsequent development workhas amply justified this decision .
