Text: the approximate analysis of certain boundary valueproblems .a simple method is given which is suitablefor the approximate analysis of certainboundary-value problems, including, forexample, the small deflections of clampedplates and the torsion of prismatic bars .the analysis is particularly simple and lendsitself well to the use of the digital computer .the method is applied here to fourproblems, the uniformly loaded, clamped square,and equilateral-triangle plates, and thetorsion of bars of square and hexagonal crosssection .  the results agree well withthe exact solutions, where these are known .
