Text: some notes for the small disturbance linear theoryof the method of local linearisation of the flow overan airfoil at mach number of unity .  in this paper, the pressuredistribution at the surface of a symmetricalnon-lifting aerofoil with free streammach number of unity has beeninvestigated by means of the small-disturbancelinear theory or the method of locallinearization .  and by comparing withthe calculated results based on anhodograph method, the accuracy of theseapproximate methods has beenevaluated .  moreover, when these approximatemethods are used for the calculationof the pressure coefficient, some notesnecessary to obtain more correctresults have been discussed .
