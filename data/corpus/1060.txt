Text: buckled states of circular plates .  authors discuss the thin elastic circular disk of constantthickness subjected to a constant compressive thrust applied at itsedge .  the analysis presented is based upon the nonlinear vonkarman equations of plate theory and is applied to disks withcompletely clamped and completely, simply supported edges .
