Text: the supersonic boom of a projectile related to dragand volume .  the whitham theory predicting the far-flow field around aprojectile is used to derive body shapes which produce extremebow shock-wave pressure jump or /boom,/ subject toconstraining conditions regarding the drag due to the bow shock andfineness ratio of the bodies .  it is found that the minimum dragbody is also the minimum boom body .  the body-volume effectand the effect of discontinuities in slope of the body meridiansection on the boom intensity is investigated .  as a general result of the investigation, it can be said that theboom of a projectile for given mach number and flight altitudeis primarily determined by its length and fineness ratio .  themaximum variation in the boom intensity for pointed bodieswith given length and fineness ratio is of the order of 10 per cent .the geometry of the bodies is thus found to play a minor role .
