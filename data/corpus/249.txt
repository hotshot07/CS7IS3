Text: formulae for the computation of the functions employedfor calculating the velocity distribution about a givenaerofoil .  in order to determine the velocity distributionabout an arbitrary aerofoil, it is necessary to evaluatethe functions and (in the notation of aerofoil theory)when is given numerically .  if the values of are specifiedat 2n points equally spaced about the circle into which theaerofoil is transformed, the formulae obtained here may beused to calculate these functions at the same points .formulae are also given for calculating the integrals of or,since these have application to the design of aerofoils bythwaites's numerical method .  the simplicity of the formulae for and enablesthe effect on the velocity distribution of a local change of shapereadily to be determined by making n large .  this isdiscussed in 3 .  the formulae are collected in the appendix, and a tableof the coefficients for the case n = 20 is given .
