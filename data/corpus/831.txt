Text: buckling of shallow shells under external pressure .a formula for the initial buckling loads for clamped, shallow sphericalshells under uniform external pressure is obtained by combining thesolutions of two linearized versions of the original nonlinear problem .one of these versions is a linear eigenvalue problem while the other isthe bending problem for a shallow cap in the linear theory ofelasticity .  the formula, which is obtained in a simple manner, yieldsbuckling loads that are in better agreement with experiments thanprevious approximate solutions to the nonlinear problem .
