Text: theory for supersonic two-dimensional, laminar, base-typeflows using the crocco-lees mixing concepts .  a separated flow field, in which the incoming boundary layeris undisturbed up to the separation point, is defined as a /base-type/ flow .  examples are the flows over a blunt base and overa backward-facing step .  the crocco-lees theory is applied tothe supersonic, two-dimensional, laminar, base-type flowsdefined above .  the separated flow is divided into a mixing regionand a recompression (or reattachment) region .  calculations ofbase pressure show its dependence on the mach number and ontwo reynolds-number-dependent variables, and .  it is shown that existing base-pressure data can be explainedby these results .
