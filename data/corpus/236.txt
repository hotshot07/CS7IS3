Text: criteria for thermodynamic equilibrium in gas flow .  when gases flow at high velocity, the ratesof internal processes may not be fast enough tomaintain thermodynamic equilibrium .  by definingquasi-equilibrium in flow as the condition in whichthe temperature, pressure, density, and velocitydeviate by less than a fixed, small percentage fromwhat they would be if the flowing gas could actuallybe in thermodynamic equilibrium, criteria arederived for determining whether quasi-equilibriumis a stable condition in the flow .  by use ofexcitation of molecular vibration as an example, thegeneral properties of criteria curves are discussed andinterpreted .  a discussion is given of how to usethese results to determine definitely whether a flowis or is not in thermodynamic equilibrium .applications to dissociating gases, to mixtures, and tothe phenomenon of /choking/ in a laval nozzleare given special consideration .  for cases whenapplication of the criteria predict nonequilibrium,equations are provided in a form useful fornumerical forward integration along streamlines .
