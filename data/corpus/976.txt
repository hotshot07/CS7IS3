Text: turbulent diffusion in the wake of a blunt nosed bodyat hypersonic speeds .  at reynolds numbers greater than about 5 x 10corresponding to altitudes below about 180,000 ft, the hot outer inviscidwake behind the bow shock wave produced by a blunt-nosedbody at hypersonic speeds is cooled mainly by turbulent diffusionand conduction .  turbulence originates in the inner wake formedby the coalescence of the free shear layers (or annulus) shed fromthe body surface when the boundary layer separates from thesurface .  as this turbulence spreads outward, it swallowsenthalpy or momentum defect originally contained in the outerinviscid wake .  if the turbulence is locally similar--i.e., if itbehaves at each station like a slice of a low-speed /self-similar/wake--then the turbulent diffusivity grows from a low initialvalue near the body to a value corresponding to the total drag ofthe body at about 300 body diameters downstream .  at flightvelocities of the order of 9,000-10,000 ft per sec. the growth of theturbulent inner wake predicted on the basis of locally similarturbulence is in good agreement with shadowgraph measurementsof wake widths behind spheres obtained in ballistic ranges in theregion from 200 to 4,000 body diameters downstream of the body .tentatively, one concludes that the turbulence mechanism in thewake with respect to a fixed observer is similar to the low-speedcase, in spite of the large mean temperature gradients .  in order to illustrate the behavior of an observable such aselectron density in a turbulent wake behind a blunt body, thetwo limiting cases of thermodynamic equilibrium and purediffusion (zero electron-ion recombination rate) are calculated form = 22 at altitudes of 100,000 and 200,000 ft .  even for thecase of thermodynamic equilibrium, the predicted turbulentradar trail length is about 200 body diameters at l-band (1,300mc) at 100,000-ft altitude and about 150 body diameters foruhf (400 mc) at 200,000 ft .  one interesting result is that thewidth of the plasma cylinder corresponding to the plasmarequency at l-band remains virtually constant at about 3.5 bodydiameters in the range 30 150 at 100,000-ft altitude .these results are sufficiently encouraging that one can considerincluding the effects of finite chemical and electron-ionrecombination rates in the analysis in order to give a more completepicture of the wake at hypersonic speeds .
