Text: note on creep buckling of columns .  this paper is concerned with the solution of the creep buckling ofcolumns .  instantaneous elastic and plastic deformations, as well asthe transient and secondary creep, are considered .  formulae for thecritical time at which a column fails are presented for integral valuesof the exponents appearing in the creep law .
