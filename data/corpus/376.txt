Text: transformation between compressible and incompressibleboundary layer equations .it is proposed to show that the boundary-layer equation ofcompressible flow can be reduced to that of incompressibleflow .  such work was initiated by stewartson and by rott andcrabtree .  in the following some of the restrictions imposed byreferences 1 and 2 will be removed, and it will be shown that thetransformation from compressible boundary layer toincompressible boundary layer can be applied to the laminar, as well asturbulent, case .  a direct method will be used for this purpose .
