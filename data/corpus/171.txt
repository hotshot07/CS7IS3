Text: a low density wind tunnel study of shock wave structureand relaxation phenomena in gases .  the profiles and thicknessesof normal shock waves of moderatestrength have been determinedexperimentally in terms of the variationof the equilibrium temperatureof an insulated transverse cylinder infree-molecule flow .  the shockwaves were produced in a steady state inthe jet of a low-density windtunnel, at initial mach numbers of 1.72and 1.82 in helium and 1.78,the shock thickness, determinedfrom the maximum slope of the cylindertemperature profile, varied frommean free path in the supersonicstream .  a comparison between theexperimental shock profiles and varioustheoretical predictions leads to thetentative conclusions that ..  (1)the navier-stokes equations are adequatefor the description of the shocktransition for initial mach numbers upto 2, and (2) the effects ofrotational relaxation times in air can beaccounted for by the introductionof a /second/ or /bulk/ viscositycoefficient equal to about two-thirdsof the ordinary shear viscosity .
