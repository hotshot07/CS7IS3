Text: an investigation of the pressure distribution on conical bodies inhypersonic flows .a large amount of work on conical flow fields without axial symmetryat supersonic speed is presently available .  however, no apparenthypersonic approximation has yet been derived .  in this note,experimental data on two elliptical cones at m = 6 are presented and ahypersonic approach obtained from physical considerations is suggested .
