Text: the extent of the jet interference flow fields .jet effects on cylindrical afterbodies housing sonic and supersonicnozzles which exhaust against a supersonic stream at angles of attackfrom 90degree to 180degree .     an investigation has been made to determine jet effects oncylindrical afterbodies housing sonic and supersonic nozzles which exhaustagainst a supersonic stream at angles of attack from 90 to 180 . thetests were conducted at a free-stream mach number of 2.91 and atfree-stream reynolds numbers, based on body diameter, of 0.15x106 andstream static pressure investigated was from jet off to about 400 .    the data presented herein showed that, in general, variation of theratio of jet total pressure to free-stream static pressure, jet-exitmach number, and ratio of jet-exit diameter to body diameter had largeinfluences on the body pressures on the windward halves of theafter-bodies and negligible influences on the leeward pressures . there was anegligible effect of reynolds number on the body pressures . the ratioof jet total pressure to free-stream static pressure also had a largeinfluence on the base pressures at all angles of attack . schlierenstudies showed details of the shock-wave structure caused by the jetand the extent of the jet interference flow fields .
