Text: flow of a gas near a solid surface .  the state of a gas near a solid surface is investigated .it is assumed that at a sufficientlylarge distance from the surface the particle distributionfunction is of the chapman-enskogform .  the half-range analysis previously employed forparallel plate geometrics (symmetricproblems) can be adapted to the single-plate problem .although the mathematical analysisdiffers, the slip coefficients are essentially identicalwith those obtained from the parallelplate problem (e.g., couette flow) .  detailed calculationsare presented for both hard sphereand maxwellian molecules .  the recent work ofbakanov and deryagin for hard spheremolecules, which is based on incorrect approximations, is discussed .
