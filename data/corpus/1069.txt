Text: design and testing of honeycomb sandwich cylindersunder axial compression .  experimental results for 36 diameter honeycomb cylindersfabricated with thin (0.010) aluminum faces and cores prove that it isquite feasible to stabilize thin faces so they can be loaded beyondthe yield point .  the effect of initial imperfections and the variousmodes of failure are discussed .
