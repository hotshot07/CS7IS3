Text: the 7 x 7 in . hypersonic wind tunnel at rae farnborough,part 1, design, instrumentation and flow visualizationtechniques .  this is the first of three parts ofthe calibration report on the r.a.e.  some details of the design and lay-outof the plant are given, togetherwith the calculated performance figures,and the major components of thefacility are briefly described .  the instrumentation provided forthe wind-tunnel is described in somedetail, including the optical and othermethods of flow visualization usedin the tunnel .  later parts will describe thecalibration of the flow in theworking-section, including temperature measurements .a discussion of the heaterperformance will also be included aswell as the results of tests to determinestarting and running pressure ratios,blockage effects, model starting loads,and humidity of the air flow .
