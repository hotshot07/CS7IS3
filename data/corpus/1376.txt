Text: some applications in physics of the p-function .  the mathematical background and typical applicationsin physics are presented for a recently tabulatedfunction .  because of its properties, the p function shouldprove to be a useful aid in the solution of certainproblems in applied mathematics involving surfaceintegrations in cylindrical coordinates .  a tabulation ofthe function in its normalized form is appended .particular attention is paid to the application of the pfunction to multiple scattering problems involvingcircular symmetry .
