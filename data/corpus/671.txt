Text: pressure and boundary-layer measurements on a two dimensional wing atlow speed .results are given of pressure measurements and boundary-layer traverseson a two-dimensional wing with 10 per cent rae 101 section at reynoldsnumbers of 1.6x10 and 3.2x10 . these results which have been integratedto give lift, drag and aerodynamic-centre characteristics, are used tocheck some calculation methods for the growth of the turbulent boundarylayer and for the effect of a known boundary layer on the pressuredistribution .it is concluded that the calculation of the boundary layer still needs alittle refinement before it is accurate enough to predict viscosityeffects on pressure distribution, lift, drag and aerodynamic center,.but that these effects can be calculated if the actual boundary-layercharacteristics are known .
