Text: a study of the application of airfoil section datato the estimation of the high subsonic speed characteristicsof swept wings .  estimates of the variation withmach number of the aerodynamiccharacteristics of swept wings are madeon the basis of airfoil sectiondata combined with span-loading theory .the analysis deals withexaminations of some 26 wings and wing-bodycombinations ranging in sweepangle from 30 to 60 and for machnumbers between 0.6 and 1.0 .  results of the study indicatethat the two-dimensional section dataafford good qualitative informationfor such high-speed aerodynamiccharacteristics as the variation withmach number of drag, zero-liftpitching-moment coefficient, and liftcoefficient for flow separation .quantitative estimates of the forceand moment divergence mach numberscould not be made with any degree ofcertainty from the airfoil dataalone .  somewhat improved quantitativeestimates for a givenconfiguration were obtainable by basing theestimates on the measuredcharacteristics for a wing of similar plan formbut different section, andadjusting for the effects of differences insection on the basis of section data .
