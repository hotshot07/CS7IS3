Text: an experimental study of jet-flap compressor blades .the results of a preliminary experimental investigation to determine the feasibility of using the jet flap to improve the sectioncharacteristics of an axial-flow compressor blade are presented and discussed trailing edge . internal design of the blade is described and detailsof the resulting jet flow are given . also included are wind-tunneldesign and test procedures for the two-dimensional cascade used in thetest .test results are presented in the form of the measured turning angle,pressure rise, and lift coefficient . they are examined with particularreference to the prevention of rotating stall .
