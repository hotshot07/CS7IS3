Text: transpiration cooling experiments in a turbulent boundarylayer at m=3 .  turbulent recovery factor and heat-transfer measurements have beenmade on a porous flat wall section at a nominal mach number of 3.0 and areynolds number of approximately 4 x 10 using both air and helium as thetranspired gas .  measured heat-transfercoefficients correlate well with thecompressible theory of rubesin for airand qualitatively with simple filmtheory for either coolant, indicating thatthe heat transfer from a turbulentboundary layer can be reduced by transpirationcooling to well below that ofthe uncooled boundary layer at the same reynolds number .
