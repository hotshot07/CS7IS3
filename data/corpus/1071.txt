Text: stability of thin torispherical shells under uniforminternal pressure .  the stability of the toroidal portion of a torispherical shellunder internal pressure is considered from the point of view of thelinear buckling theory .  a detailed stress analysis of the prebuckledshell is made employing asymptotic integration .  the change inpotential energy of the shell is then minimized using a rayleigh-ritzprocedure for actual computation of the critical pressure .  numericalresults reveal that elastic buckling may occur for very thin shellswhose material has a relatively high value of the ratio of yield stressto elastic modulus .
