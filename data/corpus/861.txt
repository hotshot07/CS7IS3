Text: charts adapted from van driest's turbulent flat-platetheory for determining values of turbulent aerodynamicfriction and heat transfer coefficients .  a modified method of van driest's flat-plate theory for turbulentboundary layer has been found to simplify the calculation of localskin-friction coefficients which, in turn, have made it possible to obtainthrough reynolds analogy theoretical turbulent heat-transfercoefficients in the form of stanton number .  a general formula is given andcharts are presented from which the modified method can be solved formach numbers 1.0 to 12.0, temperature ratios 0.2 to 6.0, and reynoldsnumbers 0.2 x 10 to 200 x 10 .
