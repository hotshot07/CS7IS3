Text: a one-foot hypervelocity shock tunnel in which high-enthalpyreal gas flows can be generated with flow times ofabout 180 milliseconds .  a shock tunnel is described inwhich high-enthalpy, real-gas airflows can be generated with flow timesof about 180 milliseconds .  thisshock tunnel is operated with acombustion-heated driver gas and consistsof a combustion chamber, shock tube,supersonic nozzle, test section, andvacuum tank .  an essential feature ofthis shock tunnel is a means forachieving a constant-pressure air reservoirfor the duration of the test .air streams with velocities in excess ofachieved at a mach number of about 10 .the corresponding stream totalenthalpy is about 4,500 btu lb and thestagnation pressure is 3.25 psia .
