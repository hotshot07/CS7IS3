Text: the temperature history in a thick skin subjected to laminar heatingduring entry into the atmosphere .during high speed entry into the earth's atmosphere, a vehicle can beafforded thermal protection for the short period of entry heating by athick outer skin, sometimes called a /heat sink/ . the temperaturedistribution in such a heat sink has been found by integrating theproduct of the laminar aerodynamic heating rate and the appropriategreen's function for a finite-thickness wall over the generalizedtrajectory for a vehicle entering the earth's atmosphere at high speedsdimensional heat conduction problem for laminar heating . the maximumsurface temperature that occurs during the generalized entry trajectoryfor any combination of wall thickness and thermal properties is obtainedfrom which the performance of any material can be found, provided thatthe average thermal properties may be used . as an example of the use of the solution, the performance of copper, graphite, molybdenum andtungsten are compared .
