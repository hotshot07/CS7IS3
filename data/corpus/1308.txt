Text: a guide to the use of the m. i. t.  cone tables .  the second and third volumes of the m.i.t. cone tables havebeen found to be unsatisfactory in two respects .  they have beencriticized because of their inconvenient tabulation and becausethe theory on which they are based is inadequate near the conesurface .  the former is climinated by means of a coordinatetransformation .  empirical evidence is presented to show thatthe latter may be ignored in practice .  the exact nature ofcertain numerical errors in the table is also pointed out .
