Text: propeller slipstream effects as determined from wingpressure distribution on a large-scale six-propellervtol model at static thrust .  during static-thrust tests of alarge-scale general research model having atilting wing and double-slotted flaps,static-pressure measurements were made ona wing segment behind one propeller tosurvey the effects of the slipstream .  forthe conditions of highest slipstream energy,the hovering end point of aerodynamicparameters for aircraft having vertical andshort take-off and landing capabilitythe tilt-wing configuration (zeroflap deflection) was a 6 spanwise variationin effective angle of attack in aspan of slightly less than 1 propeller diameter .effective changes in camberon the tilt-wing configuration as a result ofslipstream rotation, the radialvelocity gradient, and the resultant spanwiseflow were negative and had a maximummagnitude of less than 2-percent chord .  forthe deflected-slipstreamconfiguration (double-slotted flaps deflected), effectsimportant to the hoveringperformance were found, including a 40-percent spanwisevariation in effective thrustrecovery and a 20 spanwise variation in effectivethrust turning .
