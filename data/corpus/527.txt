Text: note on the three-point boundary layer problem forthe blasius equations .in a recent paper a method was presented for obtaininghigher accuracy in the numerical solution of the blasiusequation with three-point boundary conditions .  thewell-known blasius equation was previously developed in aninvestigation of the steady two-dimensional incompressibleboundary-layer flow over a flat plate, but it has been extensively used ininvestigating other fluid flow problems .  the three-pointboundary-value problem is encountered in the theory of laminarmixing and in approximate analyses of separated and wakeflows as noted in ref. 1 .
