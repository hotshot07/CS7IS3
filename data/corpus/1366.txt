Text: the compressible laminar boundary layer with heat transferand arbitrary pressure gradient .  an approximate method for the calculation of thecompressible laminar boundary layer with heat transfer andarbitrary pressure gradient, based on thwaites' correlationconcept, is presented .  the method results from the applicationof stewartson's transformation to prandtl's equations, whichyeilds a nonlinear set of two first-order differential equations .these equations are then expressed in terms of dimensionlessparameters related to the wall shear, the surface heat transfer,and the transformed free-stream velocity .  thwaites' conceptof the unique interdependence of these parameters is assumed .the evaluation of these quantities is then carried out by utilizingexact solutions recently obtained .  with the resulting relations, methods are derived for thecalculation of the two-dimensional and axially symmetriclaminar boundary layer with arbitrary free-stream velocitydistribution .  mach number, and surface temperature level .  the combined effect of heat transfer and pressure gradientis demonstrated by applying the method to calculate thecharacteristics of the boundary layer on thin supersonic surfacesand in a highly cooled, convergent-divergent, axially symmetricrocket nozzle .
