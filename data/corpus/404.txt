Text: two dimensional transonic flow past airfoils .  this report concerns the problem of constructing solutions fortransonic flows over symmetric airfoils .  the aspect of the problememphasized is, of necessity, not how to form a solution for compressibleflow but how to simplify the initial phase of the problem, namely, themapping of the incompressible flow .  in the case of the symmetricjoukowski airfoil without circulation, the mapping is relatively simple,but the coefficients in the power series are difficult to evaluate .  asa result, the problem requires simplification .  instead of the exactincompressible flow past the airfoil, an approximate flow is used, whichis derived from a combination of source and sink .  this flow differsonly slightly from the exact one when the thickness is small .  by thesame method, the flow with circulation is also considered .  after the incompressible-flow functions are approximated in thisfashion, the numerical calculation of the corresponding compressibleflow, by the hodograph theory, does not present anyessential difficulty .
