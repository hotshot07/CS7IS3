Text: note on creep buckling of columns .  a general variational theory of elastic stability that wasoriginated by e. trefftz (1) is applied to the problem ofbuckling of rings of rectangular cross section subjected touniform external pressure .  the theory is believed to bemore rigorous than previous treatments of the problem,since it avoids conventional assumptions of curved-beamtheory, such as the assumptions that plane sectionsremain plane and that radial stresses vanish .  the classicalresult of levy (2) is confirmed for a ring of infinitesimalthickness .  new results are obtained which show theeffect of the finite thickness of a ring on the coefficients inthe buckling formula .
