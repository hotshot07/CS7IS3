Text: the characteristics of roughness from insects as observedfor two-dimensional, incompressible flow past airfoils .  advances in the practical development of boundary-layercontrol for the maintenance of extensive laminar flow have drawnattention to the problem of surface roughness, due not only toartificial irregularities such as rivet heads, lap joints, windowpanels, etc., but also to the kind generated in flight from impactwith insects .  this natural form of roughening, the effects of whichhave been noted, though not investigated previously, is thesubject of the present paper .  the phenomenon may be divided into two parts--namely,and (2) its effect upon the stability of the laminar boundarylayer .  wind-tunnel experiments with the fruit fly, drosophila,and the common housefly for the investigation of both (1) andairfoils are fully described .  the former problem has also beentreated mathematically in a separate paper, not yet published,agreement between theory and experiment being satisfactory inall essentials .  the characteristics of the roughness profile consist principallyof a pronounced peak near the leading edge, followed by anextensive area of surface over which there is a much reduced andgradually diminishing value of the excrescence height .  further,it is shown that, if the severe leading-edge roughness, or its effectupon the boundary layer, can be eliminated, then thedown-stream roughness causes no disturbance to the passage of alaminar layer--i.e., the surface, though roughened, is aerodynamicallysmooth .  moreover, it appears that the conditions defining theupstream boundary to this region of insignificant roughness arefundamentally the same as those which determine the criticalstate for transition at an artificial disturbance of a three-dimensional character .
