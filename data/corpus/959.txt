Text: heat transfer in separated flows .  results of an experimental heat-transfer investigation inregions of separated flow are presented and compared with thetheoretical analysis of naca tn 3792 .  the average heattransfer for both laminar and turbulent separated boundarylayers was found to be from 35 to 50 per cent less than that forequivalent attached boundary layers .  the overall scope of themeasurements included mach numbers from 0.3 to 4.0 andreynolds numbers from 10 to 4 x 10 .  the results for laminarboundary layers agree well with the analysis of tn 3792 .  theresults for turbulent boundary layers, however, disagreeconsiderably .  results of velocity and temperature surveys in theseparated turbulent boundary layer are presented and partiallyexplain the discrepancy between the experiments and analysis .the maximum local heat-transfer rates were found to occur inthe reattachment region of the separated boundary layersinvestigated .  the effect of transition on heat transfer in the separatedlaminar boundary layers is described and data showing effectsof mach number and wall temperature on the transitionreynolds number of separated laminar flows are also included .
