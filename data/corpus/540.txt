Text: use of local similarity concepts in hypersonic viscousinteraction problems .  the problem of predicting the characteristicsof a hypersonic laminar boundary layer thatinteracts with the external flow field is approachedusing the tangent wedge formulation forthe inviscid flow field and the method of similarsolutions for the viscous flow .  it is shownthat the concept of local similarity which allowsthe pressure gradient parameter to vary inthe streamwise direction leads to an explicitrelation between the viscous and inviscid flowsfor all values of the hypersonic interactionparameter .  the conditions of /strong/ andlimits of the general relations .  the present theoryis compared with three independent experimentalinvestigations .  in each case, theagreement is found to be excellent over the range ofinvestigated .  it is shown, using asymptoticsolutions to the exact boundary layer equations,that the present theory is applicable to a widevariety of viscous interaction problems .a large number of solutions to the laminarboundary layer similarity equations for a perfectgas with cross flow and surface mass transfer aregiven .  these numerical results, when combinedwith the solutions of previous authors, aresufficient to describe the range of conditions with high precision .
