Text: on the analogues relating flexure and extension offlat plates .  the displacement of a flat plate bentby transverse loading, and the extensionalor in 'plane stress', are governed by equationsof identical form ,. and the boundaryconditions have identical form whenedge-displacements are specified in the flexural,edge-tractions in the extensional problem,so mathematically, in these circumstances,only a single problem is presented .  this,the 'first analogue' relating flexure andextension, is well known .  a 'second analogue', relating the flexuralproblem when edge-tractions with theextensional problem when edge-displacementsare specified, is believed to have beenfirst propounded in 1941 .  by introducingtwo quantities u and v, analogous withthe components u and v of extensionaldisplacement, it permits a treatment of theflexural problem by any method--e.g.which yields extensional solutions of thissecond type .  in this paper both analogues are combinedin an inclusive statement covering theperforated (multiply connected) plates whichwere discussed in 1948 .  reasons arestated for believing that 'two-diagram technique'is preferable in problems governedby 'mixed' boundary conditions .
