Text: atmospheric entries with vehicle lift-drag ratio modulatedto limit deceleration and rate of deceleration vehicleswith maximum lift-drag ratio of 0. 5.  an analysis has been made ofatmosphere entries for which thevehicle lift-drag ratio was modulatedto maintain specified maximumdecelerations and or maximum decelerationrates .  the part of thevehicle drag polar used during modulationwas from maximum liftcoefficient to minimum drag coefficient .  theentries were at parabolic velocityand the vehicle maximum lift-drag ratiowas 0.5 .  two-dimensionaltrajectory calculations were made for anonrotating, spherical earth with anexponential atmosphere .  the resultsof the analysis indicate that for agiven initial flight-path angle,modulation generally resulted in areduction of the maximum decelerationto 60 percent of the unmodulated value ora reduction of maximum decelerationrate to less than 50 percent of theunmodulated rate .  these results wereequivalent, for a maximumdeceleration of 10g, to lowering the undershootboundary 24 miles with a resultingdecrease in total convective heating tothe stagnation point of 22 percent .however, the maximum convective heatingrate was increased 18 percent,. themaximum radiative heating rate and totalradiative heating were eachincreased about 10 percent .
