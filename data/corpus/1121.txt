Text: compressive and torsional buckling of thin-wall cylindersin the yield region .  based on assumptions which haveled to the best agreement betweentheory and test data on inelasticbuckling of flat plates, a general setof equilibrium differential equationsfor the plastic buckling ofcylinders has been derived .  these equationshave been used to obtainsolutions for the compressive and torsionalbuckling of long cylinders inthe yield region .  test data are presented which indicatesatisfactory agreement withthe theoretical plasticity-reductionfactors in most cases .  where adifference in results exists, test dataare in substantially betteragreement with the results obtained by use ofthe maximum-shear law ratherthan the octahedral-shear law to transformaxial stress-strain data toshear stress-strain data .
