Text: combinations of temperature and axial compression requiredfor buckling of a ring-stiffened cylinder .  a theory is presented to predict the buckling temperature of anaxially compressed, uniformly heated ring-stiffened cylinder .  thecylinder buckles because of the interaction of the axial stress due toapplied compressive loads and the circumferential stress resultingfrom restraint of thermal expansion by the rings .  buckling chartscovering a wide range of cylinder proportions are presented for bothclamped and simply supported cylinders .  the buckling temperature for agiven axial loading is determined from a simple equation involving acoefficient given in the buckling charts and the radius-thickness ratioof the cylinder .
