Text: oscillatory aerodynamic coefficients for a unifiedsupersonic hypersonic strip theory .  this investigation presents a derivation of the oscillatoryaerodynamic coefficients for wings with supersonic leading edgesfrom the second-order, nonlinear, unsteady, supersonic flow theoryof van dyke .  the theory is considered applicable throughoutthe supersonic-hypersonic regime at mach numbers normal tothe leading edge and reduced frequencies for which .the coefficients are modified for sweep, and a finite-spancorrection is suggested to increase the accuracy of strip-theory flutteranalyses .  the limiting values of the coefficients in steady floware also discussed .
