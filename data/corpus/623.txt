Text: on the coupling between heat and mass transfer .in mixtures of two different gases or liquids, one constituentwill migrate spontaneously toward the warmer parts, andthe other toward the colder parts .  this phenomenon, knownas the soret effect, and its converse the dufour effect, werediscovered as early as 1856 and 1873 respectively .  the twoeffects can also be considered as a simultaneous transport ofmass and heat, or as a coupling between heat and mass transfer .the effects of this coupling have been neglected in allinvestigations of heat transfer in multicomponent flow systems so far,on the a priori assumption that they are small .  in a recentpublication however, it was shown that they can be large inlaminar-boundary-layer-type flows with helium injection .turbulent-boundary-layer measurements and an analysis conductedat the heat transfer laboratory clearly showed significanteffects of the coupling on heat transfer and adiabatic walltemperature .  from additional measurements, the results of whichare presented below, it is possible to separate the heat flux at themodel wall into one part depending on the temperature gradientand a second part caused by the coupling .  it is shown thatthe latter exceeds the former, and hence the coupling may notbe neglected a priori without careful consideration .
