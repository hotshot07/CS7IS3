Text: effects of rapid heating on strength of airframe components .  results of several experimentalinvestigations are presented whichindicate the effects of rapid heatingon the bending strength of multiwebbeams and ring-stiffened cylinders .it is shown that thermal stressesreduce the bending load carried atbuckling by both beams and cylinders .the influence of thermal stress onmaximum load is found to dependlargely on the mode of buckling .for beams that buckle locally, noapparent effect of thermal stress onthe maximum load has been found .a reduction in maximum load has beenobserved for beams that buckle inthe wrinkling mode and for cylinders .
