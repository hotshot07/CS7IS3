Text: similarity laws for stressing heated wings .  it will be shown that the differential equations for a heatedplate with large temperature gradient and for a similar plate atconstant temperature can be made the same by a propermodification of the thickness and the loading for the isothermal plate .this fact leads to the result that the stresses in the heated platecan be calculated from measured strains on the unheated plate bya series of relations, called the /similarity laws ./  theapplication of this analog theory to solid wings under aerodynamicheating is discussed in detail .  the loading on the unheated analogwing is, however, complicated and involves the novel conceptof feedback and /body force/ loading .  the problem of stressinga heated box-wing structure can be solved by the same analogmethod and is briefly discussed .
