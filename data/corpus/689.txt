Text: investigation of the laminar aerodynamics heat transfercharacteristics of a hemisphere cylinder in the langley11-inch hypersonic tunnel at a mach number of 6. 8.  a program to investigate the aerodynamic heat transfer of anonisothermal hemisphere-cylinder has been conducted in thelangley 11-inch hypersonic tunnel at a mach number of 6.8and a reynolds number from approximately 0.14x10 toexperimental heat-transfer coefficients were slightly less over thewhole body than those predicted by the theory of stine andwanlass (naca technical note 3344) for an isothermalsurface .  for stations within 45 of the stagnation point theheat-transfer coefficients could be correlated by a single relationbetween local stanton number and local reynolds number .  pitot pressure profiles taken at a mach number of 6.8 on ahemisphere-cylinder have verified that the local mach number orvelocity outside the boundary layer required in the theories maybe computed from the surface pressures by using isentropic flowrelations and conditions immediately behind a normal shock .the experimental pressure distribution at a mach number ofvelocity gradients calculated at the stagnation point by usingthe modified newtonian theory vary with mach number andare in good agreement with those obtained from measuredpressures for mach numbers from 1.2 to 6.8 .  at the stagnation point the theory of sibulkin, in which thediameter and conditions behind the normal shock were used,was in good agreement with the experiment when the velocitygradient at the stagnation point appropriate to the free-streammach number was used .
