Text: magnetohydrodynamic flow past a semi-infinite plate .  the flow of viscous electrically conducting fluidpast a semi-infinite plate is considered .  theapplied constant magnetic field and the constanton-coming velocity of the fluid are in the direction parallelto the plate .  in addition to reynolds number the flow in theboundary layer depends on two parametersand .  the two simultaneousordinary nonlinear differential equations are solved bythe asymptotic method for the cases whenand respectively .  the main results obtained are as follows .  theequations can be solved exactly for and  .the perturbation effect from infinity when k is largedepends on, whereas the perturbation effect fromzero when k is small depends on .  for large k,including there is no solution for .  it isassumed that the fluid is incompressible with constantphysical properties .
