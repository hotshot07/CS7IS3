Text: an investigation of wing-aileron flutter using groundlaunched rocket models .  control surface flutter of thewing torsion-control rotation type hasbeen investigated for an unswept wingwith an under-massbalanced, half span,outboard aileron .  thirteen pairs ofwings were tested, using ground launchedrocket driven vehicles, and a range ofvalues of aileron natural frequencywas covered .  the test results showedconsiderable scatter, but enabledupper and lower limits of a flutterboundary to be determined approximately .it was established that aileron fluttercould be eliminated on the modelstested provided the aileron frequencyexceeded the wing torsional frequencyby 20 per cent or more .  in thiscondition the models were also free fromsingle degree of freedom flutter
