Text: the design of tubes under uniform external pressure on thebasis of assumed inaccuracies .since the failure of tubes under uniform external pressure dependsvery much upon the various kinds of imperfections in them,it seems logical to derive a design formula for such tubes inwhich the quantities depending on imperfections will appear explicitly .the most common imperfection in tubes is an initial ellipticity,the limiting value of which in each type of tube is usually well-knownfrom numerous inspection measurements .  the deviation of the shapeof the tube from a perfect circular form can be defined by theinitial radial deflections w' .
