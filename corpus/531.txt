Text: the flow about a moving body in the upper ionosphere .  a particle approach is used to study the flow pattern around abody moving in the upper layers of the ionosphere .  the effectsof distant encounters between charged particles (dynamicfriction) and of the earth's magnetic field are taken into account .it is shown that, when the magnetic lines of force are parallelto the direction of motion of the body, there may be a markedconcentration of charged particles in the vicinity of the bodyand a considerable fraction of the reflected or deflected chargedparticles may reimpinge on the body surface .  a numericalexample is given for the size and shape of the charged-particle-density contours in the flow field surrounding a circular disc,and these are compared with the corresponding neutral-particlecontours .
