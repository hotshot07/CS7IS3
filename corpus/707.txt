thermal analysis of stagnation regions with emphasis on heat-sustainingnose shapes at hypersonic speeds .the leading edges and noses of hypersonic vehicles are subjected tosevere aerodynamic heating and must be cooled in some manner-dash e.g.,internal convection, transpiration, or radiation . it is this lattermode of handling the problem that is discussed in this paper .neglecting conduction in the leading-edge region, the maximum temperature forlong-range hypersonic gliders is of the same order as the melting pointof refractory materials, with a corresponding large temperature gradient away from the leading edge . inclusion of conduction in the aftdirection reduces the maximum temperature and distributes the heat to alocation that will radiate it out from the surface . for eithersteady-state or transient conditions, the temperature at the leading edge isreduced by conduction, while the temperature aft of the leading-edgeshoulder is increased, thus setting up a heat transmission balancebetween the convective influx of heat, the redistribution of heat byconduction, and the radiation of heat from the surface . the feasibility of such a mechanism can be enhanced by suitably choosing leading-edgeshapes and materials . the philosophy behind the choice of leading-edgeshapes is discussed and the effects of varying parameters, such asshape, diameter, emissivity, conductivity, thickness, etc., are shown .
