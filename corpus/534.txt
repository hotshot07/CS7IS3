consideration of energy separation for laminar slipflow in a circular tube .  the energy separation for laminar low-density-nonunity prandtlnumber flow in circular cross-section tubes is the topic of thisnote .  a conclusion is reached as to the effect of prandtl numberon the velocity profiles for these flows .  however, in order toreach valid quantitative conclusions the reviewer feels that moredetailed analysis is in order, and that the analysis as presentedhere is of qualitative value only .
