Text: principles of creep buckling weight-strength analysisof aircraft structures .  the possibility of a gradual instabilityfailure of a column undercompressive load has been recognizedfor some time .  marin presented ananalysis of creep buckling based ona theory of creep bending, but did nottake into account the average stressdue to axial loading .  the theory alsoneglected the transient (nonlinear)portion of the creep curve .  in efficient column design, theaverage stress should be relatively high incomparison with the bending stresses,.that is, the column should be as straightas possible and the slenderness ratioshould not be too great .  under theseconditions marin's theory is notdirectly applicable, although it gives goodagreement with tests of columnshaving large slenderness ratios or largeeccentricities .
