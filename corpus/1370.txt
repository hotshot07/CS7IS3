Text: some remarks on the flat plate boundary layer .  the authors discuss the solutions for the flow of a viscousincompressible fluid near the leading edge of a semi-infiniteflat plate without pressure gradient .  the oseenlinearization is employed which approximates the equations of motionand continuity bywhere are the coordinate directions, thecorresponding velocity components and the uniform free streamvelocity which is parallel to the plate .  defining aperturbation stream function bythe differentialequation to be solved is with boundaryconditions far from the plate andwhen y=0 and .  the authors discuss theproblem by applying the two-dimensional fouriertransform and obtain an explicit solution for the velocity gradientat the plate which is in disagreementwith the result of the blasius solution .  from thisthe authors conclude that it would be more appropriate touse a velocity other than in the linearization of theequations of motion and suggest replacing by where .this choice does not affect the solution far fromthe plate but gives on the plate and incomparison with blasius solution indicates that c=0.35 .the solution of the modified oseen equation with this valueof c then seems acceptable as the approximate solution inthe region intermediate between the stokes flow and thefree stream .  on the basis of these considerations, the authorssuggest an iteration procedure for obtaining the exactsolution for the above problem as well as a solution for the plateof finite length .
