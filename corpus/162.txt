nearly circular transfer trajectories for descendingsatellites .  simplified expressions describing the transferfrom a satellite orbit to the point of atmosphericentry are derived .  the expressions are limited toaltitude changes that are small compared with theearth's radius, and velocity changes small comparedwith satellite velocity .  they are further restrictedto motion about a spherical, nonrotating earth .  the transfer orbit resulting from the applicationof thrust in any direction at any point in an ellipticorbit is considered .  expressions for the errors indistance (miss distance) and entry angle due to aninitial misalinement and magnitude error of thedeflecting thrust are presented .  the largest potential contributing factor towardsa miss distance stems from the misalinement of theretrovelocity increment .  if this velocity increment ispointed in direct opposition to the flight path, a 1misalinement leads to a miss distance of 34.5 miles .however, it is shown that this error can be avoidedby applying the velocity increment at an anglebetween 120 and 150 below the flight-path direction .  the guidance and accuracy requirements toestablish a circular orbit, in addition to the correctionsapplied to transform elliptic orbits into circularones, are also discussed .
