note on creep buckling of columns .  this paper describes theory and tests of the creep collapseof long thin aluminum-alloy cylinders under external radialpressure .  steady-state creep is assumed in the theoreticalderivation .  the test temperatures were between 300 and 500 f .the collapse time for each cylinder was calculated theoretically .agreement between theoretical and test results was fair .
