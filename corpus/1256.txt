Text: fluctuating lift and drag acting on a cylinder in aflow at supercritical reynolds numbers .  the fluctuating lift and drag acting on a circular cylinder in aflow of an incompressible fluid at large reynolds numbers weremeasured .  data on the root-mean-square values of the lift anddrag coefficients, the extreme values of these coefficients, andtheir power spectra at various reynolds numbers are presented .
