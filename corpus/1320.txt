Text: divergence of plate airfoils of low aspect ratio atsupersonic speeds .  in part (1), as a first approach to a theoretical investigationof low aspect ratio rectangular plate wings of constant thickness,the two assumptions are made that ..  (a) the spanwise form ofthe structural distortion is known, leaving the chordwisedistortion arbitrary,. and (b) the aerodynamic forces areapproximations of the supersonic linearized theory .  the form of thechordwise distortion is then deduced from the differentialequation representing the state of neutral equilibrium for smalldisplacements at the critical divergence speed .  secondly, this problem is investigated using measuredstructural flexibility coefficients together with theoreticalaerodynamic coefficients .  thirdly, the usual series solution based on the rayleigh-ritzapproach is discussed, using the same assumptions as in the firstmethod .  all the results of these methods are consistent and indicate thatthe transonic regime at m = 1 is the most critical fordivergence .  in part (2), it is established that sweeping the leading edge ofa plate airfoil of constant thickness increases its stability .  forangles of sweep less than 30, the critical conditions occur whenthe leading edge is sonic, but for angles greater than 30 thecritical conditions occur when m = 1 .
