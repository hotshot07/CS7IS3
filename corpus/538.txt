the conpressibility transformation and the turbulentboundary layer equations .  the compressibility transformation first introduced bydorod-nitzyn has been applied in this paper to the equations of theturbulent boundary layer on a flat plate, considering heat transferand arbitrary prandtl numbers .  assuming the sheardistribution to be invariant under the transformation, the streamfunction and the momentum equation take the proper form forincompressible flow, allowing the use of incompressible velocityprofiles in the transformed coordinates .  application of crocco'smethod to the transformed energy equation permits integrationof the energy equation resulting in a formulism remarkablysimilar to that proposed by eckert .  finally, the referencecondition was chosen to correspond to the edge of the sublayer fromconsiderations of the assumptions made regarding theshear-stress distribution .  with this choice, the reference enthalpy is ingood agreement with eckert's formula over the ordinary range oftest conditions .  in view of these results, the analysis may beconsidered to provide a theoretical basis for thereference-enthalpy method .
