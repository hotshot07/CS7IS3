thermal diffusion effects on energy transfer in a turbulentboundary layer with helium injection .  a circular cylinder with two-inchdiameter and with a porous wallfabricated out of woven wire material wasaligned with its axis parallel to an airstream with approximately 100 ft secvelocity .  helium gas was injected intothe turbulent boundary layer throughthe cylinder walls at a uniform rate inthe range 1.55 x 10 to 1.08 x 10of the free stream mass velocity .  thelocal energy transfer along the cylinderwas measured at various values ofthe wall temperature level for thesituation that the energy flows from thecylinder to the boundary layer andvice versa .  the results showed clearlythat the wall temperature for zeroenergy transfer - the adiabatic walltemperature - was larger than the freestream temperature by up to about 40 f,although viscous dissipation effectsare negligible .  this temperature excessincreases with increasing injectionrate and is independent of reynoldsnumber .  an analysis in which the laminarsublayer is treated as couette flowwith helium injection and which includesthermal diffusion in this layer isformulated .  the results show appreciablethermal diffusion effects onadiabatic wall temperature, increasing itover its value for zero injectionby amounts of the same order of magnitudeas found by measurements .  thermaldiffusion however has negligible effectson the heat transfer coefficient .its effects on the concentration andtemperature distribution are discussedand are shown to produce appreciablemodifications in the latter .
