supersonic flow around blunt bodies .the newtonian theory of impact has been shown to beuseful for pressure calculations on the forward facing partof bodies moving at high speed .  it is now a familiar practiceto use this information to calculate nonviscous velocities at thewall and then to estimate rates of heat transfer .  thisprocedure is perhaps open to question,. heat-transfer rates dependon velocity gradients which are not given by the newtoniananalysis .  nor can one obtain information on boundary-layerstability or all the body stability derivatives .  it seems,therefore, inevitable that, as design proceeds with these hypersonicmissiles, there will be a greater need for more accurateaerodynamic theories either to predict what will happen in unfamiliarflight conditions or to effect an extrapolation from a known testresult to the design condition .
