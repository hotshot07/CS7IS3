studies of the use of freon-12 as a wind tunnel testingmedium .  a number of studies relating tothe use of freon-12 as asubstitute medium for air in aerodynamictesting have been made .  theuse of freon-12 instead of air makespossible large savings inwind-tunnel drive power .  because of thefact that the ratio of specificheats is approximately 1.13 for freon-12as compared with 1.4 for air,some differences exist between dataobtained in freon-12 and in air .methods for predicting aerodynamiccharacteristics of bodies in airfrom data obtained in freon-12, however,have been developed from theconcept of similarity of the streamlinepattern .  these methods,derived from consideration of two-dimensionalflows, provide substantialagreement in all cases for which comparativedata are available .  thesedata consist of measurements throughouta range of mach number fromapproximately 0.4 to 1.2 of pressuredistributions and hinge moments onswept and unswept wings having aspectratios ranging from 4.0 to 9.0,including cases where a substantialpart of the wing was stalled .  the freon charging and recoverysystem used for the langleylow-turbulence pressure tunnel is described .
