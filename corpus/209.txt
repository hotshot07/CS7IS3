Text: boundary layer induced noise in the interior of aircraft .  at high speeds the turbulent boundary layer washing theairplane fuselage excites appreciable skin vibration, promoting strongnoise in the interior .  the fluctuating exciting pressure distributioncan be represented as a pattern of moving waves (fourier integral) .a running ripple in the skin follows underneath each wave, and the noiseis ultimately due to these ripples .  the acoustic effects of the running ripples are calculatedfor an infinite sheet,. this is considered the main result of thepaper .  supersonically moving ripples radiate strong sound in the formof mach waves,. subsonically moving ripples radiate no sound .  formulasfor the mean square surface pressure and the energy flux are obtainedfor an assumed idealized turbulent pressure spectrum .  the results are adapted to provide a tentative estimate ofthe noise generated at subsonic speeds in a practical fuselage .  therunning ripples are almost noise-free, but multiple reflections at theframes and stringers promote standing waves .  an assumption is usedto link the two kinds of waves, and this leads to provisionalcalculations of noise level ..  on this basis the noise level ispredicted to vary as for thin boundary layers, changingprogressively to for thick layers ( = external airdensity, = speed, = layer thickness, = panel thickness) .  somecomparisons are made with experiment .  finally, an idea forminimizing the noise is presented .
