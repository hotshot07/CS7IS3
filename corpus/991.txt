Text: wing-flow study of pressure drag reduction at transonic speed byprojecting a jet of air from the nose of a prolate spheroid of finenessratio 6 .a study was made at transonic speeds by the naca wing-flow method of the pressure-drag reduction obtained by projecting a high-energy jet of air from the nose of a prolate spheroid . supplementary information wasobtained by taking shadowgraphs of the model mounted in a smallsupersonic tunnel at a constant mach number of 1.5 .the high-velocity jet was observed to alter the pressure distributionover the body in such a way that the pressure drag of the body wasreduced,. thus, in a restricted sense, the nose jet produced a thrust on the body . under the conditions investigated, the thrust produced bythe nose jet was never so large as that which would be expected from aconventional rearward jet . for example, under the best conditionstested /mach number of 1.07/ the reduction in body pressure drag causedby the nose jet more than compensated for the negative thrust of the jet itself . however, the magnitude of the net reduction in drag /change in body pressure drag with jet on and jet off minus the adverse thrust ofthe jet/ was only about one-half of the thrust which would be producedby the same jet exhausting rearward . the appearance of such anunexpectedly large effect in the first trial indicated the phenomenon to beworth further study .
