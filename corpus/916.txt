the flow around oscillating low aspect ratio wings at transonicspeeds .when certain conditions are fulfilled for thickness ratio, aspect ratio, and reduced frequency for a three-dimensional wing, it can be shownthat the partial differential equation for the non-steady perturbationpotential can be reduced to a comparatively simple linear equation .the solution is then obtained by applying a fourier transformation inthe free-stream direction and then using an iterative process developedby adams and sears for steady flow . the method gives solutions validfor low combinations of aspect ratio and reduced frequency .the method is applied to a delta wing oscillating in some selected rigid and elastic modes . from the results it can be seen that the specialnon-steady forces in the potential equation, which are neglected inslender-body theory, are very important . stability derivatives can also be obtained by the method and it is seen that the damping in pitch maybe negative at m 1 for delta wings of too high aspect ratio .
