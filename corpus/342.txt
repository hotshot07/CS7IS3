effect of diffusion fields on the laminar boundarylayer .  a theory is developed which describes the effect of a generaldiffusion field on the dynamic and thermal characteristics of alaminar boundary layer on a flat plate in steady compressibleflow .  fluid properties are considered as functions oftemperature and local concentration of the foreign gas .  the diffusionfield is described by a differential equation that relatesconvective and diffusion transfer and which considers diffusion currentsarising from gradients of concentration and temperature .  bymeans of the usual transformations the system is reduced to a setof ordinary differential equations, which in turn are transformedinto a set of integral equations .  the latter is amenable tosolution by the method of successive approximations .  the theory and results have bearing on the problem of controland reduction of aerodynamic heating at hypersonic speeds .the special feature of this approach lies in the utilization ofdiffusion fields for the purpose of reducing the detrimental effectsof viscous dissipation .  although the theory is adapted to afuller investigation of this problem, the numerical examplesconsidered involve mainly diffusion fields of helium, with whichgood results have been achieved at mach numbers 8 and 12 .whereas at the higher mach number the influx of heat waspractically eliminated, a reversal in the direction of heat flow hasbeen effected at the lower mach number .
