Text: on the use of side-jets as control devices .  wind tunnel experiments with side-jets, issuing laterallynear the base of slender bodies in a supersonic stream, havesuggested the existence of a sizable and usable interaction .with this interaction force, the use of jet reaction controlsmay be as attractive for flight within the atmosphere as itobviously is for flight outside the atmosphere .  this noteindicates the altitude regime of interest and the order ofmagnitude of the interaction bonus for a lateral controljet located near the base of a body of revolution .
