Text: a sublayer for fluid injection into the incompressibleturbulent boundary layer .  a sublayer region is introduced in which the intensity ofturbulence grows at a prescribed rate .  the decrease in wall shearstress due to fluid injection into the boundary layer is found underthe hypothesis that the effect of injection is restricted to thesublayer region .  experimental measurements of the velocityprofiles with fluid injection substantiate this hypothesis .  thetheoretical decrease in wall shear stress is in good agreementwith experiment,. the solution is particularly simple and for smallvalues of the injection parameter it contains no arbitraryparameters .  the theory provides a similarity parameter which differsfrom the one in general use .
