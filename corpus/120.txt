Text: measurement of convective heat transfer by means ofthe reynolds analogy .preston's method for measuring skin friction in pipes hasbeen extended to include non-uniform flow, with andwithout pressure gradients, over flat surfaces .  by means of amodified form of the reynolds analogy, the localconvective heat transfer coefficient can be related to the skinfriction, and it is proposed that the method be used inaerodynamic models of furnaces and in heat transfer plantof simple geometry .  more investigations are required ofthe effects of fluid turbulence, surface roughness andsurface curvature on convective heat transfer and skinfriction .
