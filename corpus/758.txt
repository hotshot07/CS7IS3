the lower bound of attainable sonic-boom over-pressureand design methods of approaching this limit .  from a study of existing sonic-boomtheory it has been possible to establishan approximate lower bound of attainablesonic-boom overpressure, which dependsonly on the airplane length, weight, andvolume and on the flight conditions .this lower bound may be approached overa narrow range of flight conditionsthrough the application of appropriatedesign considerations .  in general, forintermediate values of lift coefficientthe major portion of the lift generatingsurfaces must be located aft of themaximum cross-sectional area, whereas forhigher values of lift coefficientthe maximum area must be well forward and orthe lift-producing surfaces must extend well toward the airplane nose .
