lift on inclined bodies of revolution in hypersonic flow .the importance of body lift lies in the fact that at moderate angles ofattack and high mach number it can constitute an appreciable part ofthe total lift of a winged missile . in this paper an attempt has beenmade to analyze body lift in hypersonic flow by an approximate methodand, together with a correlation of existing experimental data, toindicate the probable variation of body lift over a wide range of machnumbers extending from low supersonic to hypersonic . the method ofanalysis of hypersonic flow over inclined bodies of revolution employedherein has been denoted as the hypersonic approximation . it is animprovement on the newtonian corpuscular theory of aerodynamics, since itconsiders the centrifugal forces resulting from the curved paths of theair particles in addition to the impact /newtonian/ forces .
