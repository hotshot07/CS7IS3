mathematical techniques applying to the thermal fatigue behaviourof high temperature alloys .during thermal fatigue testingof a specimen with a thin edge, orduring rapid temperature changes in the gasflow past turbine blades, the thinedges are deformed plastically in compressionduring heating and subsequentlycreep in tension as the bulk of the specimenor blade heats up . the plasticdeformation is determined from temperaturedistributions, which are calculatedby biot's variational method . the creepdeformation is determined as a functionof time by a differential equation, whichexpresses the balance between increasingelastic stress and reduction of stress dueto creep relaxation, and which is solvedto a riccati equation soluble interms of bessel functions, or (iii) by transformationto a second-order differentialequation with a periodic coefficient .using the thermal stresses obtained fromthe solution of the differential equation, the theoretical thermalfatigue enduranceis determined from cyclic (mechanical) stressendurance data . agreement betweentheoretical and experimental thermal fatigueendurances is obtained, over rangesof temperature, strain, and strain rate, or equivalently, over rangesof temperature-edge radius and heat transfer coefficient .this agreement supports the use ofthe theoretical methods in wider contexts .the accuracy of the temperaturedistributions is better than the accuracy ofother factors entering into the correlationbetween theoretical and experimental endurances .improvement in theinterpretation of experimental results requiresconsideration of the alterationof the stress  cycles during the course of thermalfatigue testing . this requirementis catered for partially by the various solutions of the differentialequation for thermal stress .
