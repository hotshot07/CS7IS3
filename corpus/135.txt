Text: the calculation of wall shearing stress from heat-transfer measurementsin compressible flows .it has been shown by ludwieg that the wall shearing stress of a laminaror turbulent boundary layer in an incompressible flow can be determinedfrom a heat-transfer measurement at the surface .  the instrumentused in that investigation was essentially a small, locally insulated,heating element embedded in the test surface .  the size of theinstrument was restricted by the condition that the thermal boundary layergenerated by the heating element be contained locally within the laminarsublayer .  in the present analysis ludweig's theory for such aninstrument is extended to compressible flow over an insulated flat plate .with the same limitations on the design and operation of the instrumentas mentioned above, it can also be assumed for compressible laminarand turbulent boundary layers that only the flow in the immediatevicinity of the wall or the laminar sublayer will be affected in the regionof the heated element .  this assumption then permits the use of thelaminar boundary-layer equations as the governing equations for thisanalysis for both laminar and turbulent boundary layers .
