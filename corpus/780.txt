Text: the transonic characteristics of 38 cambered rectangularwings of varying aspect ratio and thickness as determinedby transonic-bump technique .  an investigation to determinethe effects of camber on theaerodynamic characteristics of a seriesof rectangular wings having variousaspect ratios and thickness-to-chordratios was conducted in the amesthe transonic-bump method .the mach number range of theinvestigation was from 0.6 to 1.12, witha corresponding reynolds numberrange of 1.7 to 2.2 million .  the lift,drag, and pitching-moment dataare presented for wings having aspectratios of 4, 3, 2, 1.5, and 1,and naca 63a2xx and 63a4xx sections withthickness-to-chord ratios of
