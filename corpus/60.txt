estimation forces and moments due to rolling for severalslender tail configurations at supersonic speeds .  the velocity potentials, span loadings, and corresponding forceand moment derivatives have been theoretically evaluated for a numberof slender-tail arrangements performing a steady rolling motion atsupersonic speeds .  the method of analysis is based upon an application ofconformal-transformation techniques .  the utilization of these techniques allowsthe simple determination of the complex potentials for various typesof two-dimensional boundary-value problems .  in addition, two simple and often-used approximations to therolling derivatives have been compared with the corresponding exactvalues determined by the method presented in this report .  in order to show the importance of wing-tail interference, theeffect of the flow field behind a rolling wing on the tailcharacteristics has been illustrated for a simple wing-tail arrangement .
