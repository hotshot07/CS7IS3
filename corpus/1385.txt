Text: air flow in a separating laminar boundary layer .  the speed distribution in a laminar boundary layer onthe surface of an elliptic cylinder, of major and minoraxes 11.78 and 3.98 inches, respectively, has beendetermined by means of a hot-wire anemometer .  the directionof the impinging air stream was parallel to the major axis .special attention was given to the speed distribution inthe region of separation and to the exact location of thepoint of separation .  an approximate method, developedby k. pohlhausen for computing the speed distribution,the thickness of the layer, and the point of separation, isdescribed in detail,. and speed-distribution curvescalculated by this method are presented for comparison withexperiment .  good agreement is obtained along theforward part of the cylinder, but pohlhausen's method failsshortly before the separation point is reached andconsequently cannot be used to locate this point .  the work was carried out at the national bureau ofstandards with the cooperation and financial assistanceof the national advisory committee for aeronautics .
