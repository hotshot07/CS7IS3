Text: the calculation of the pressure distribution on thickwings of small aspect ratio at zero lift in subsonicflow .  the method of expressing the velocity incrementover aerofoils directly in terms of the section ordinateswings of finite aspect ratio .  the wings considered areuntapered in plan-form but may be tapered in thickness .the section can be of any given shape so that in this sensethe analysis is more general than that of refs. 3 to 6 whichdeal with wings of biconvex section .  the coefficients required in the calculation are tabulatedfor the centre-section of straight and swept-back wingsof aspect ratios 0.5,. 1,. 2,. and 4, the wing of infiniteaspect ratio having beentreated in ref. 1 .  the remaining calculations can be madevery quickly .  since wings of very small aspect ratio can be treated also bythe method of slender-body theory, the relations betweenlinear theory, slender-body theory, and linearised slender-bodytheory are discussed .  for the special case of ellipsoids,the results obtained from the various methods are comparedwith the exact solution .
