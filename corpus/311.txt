Text: a method for predicting the onset of buffeting and other separationeffects from wind tunnel tests on rigid models .the method is based on the observation of the divergence that occurs inthe variation of mean static pressure at the trailing edge of anaircraft wing at the critical stage in the development of boundary-layerseparation when its influence first spreads to the trailing edge andthereby to the overall flow .the significance of the trailing-edge pressure variations and theirconnection with the effects that separation has on the mean and unsteady loads is discussed for various types of separation . good predictioncan be obtained from wind-tunnel tests, or warning provided in flight,for low-speed separations and for shock-induced ones up to the stage atwhich the shock wave reaches the trailing edge . related divergences inwake width, lift coefficient, or shock position can also be used .pressure measurements at other isolated points often indicate the typeof separation .certain special considerations apply for swept wings .the various flow changes that are considered are illustrated byschlieren photographs and described in an appendix .
