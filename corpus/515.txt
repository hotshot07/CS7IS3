self sustained oscillations of a system with non-lineardamping of a particular type .  the paper deals with self-sustainedoscillations of a dynamic systemof single degree of freedom, with linearrestoring force and non-lineardamping force .  the latter is supposedto be a function of velocityrepresentable by a simple /polygonal/graph, such that the damping isnegative at small velocities but becomespositive at velocities above acertain value .  on these assumptions,a rigorous solution is presented,including the equations of motion,amplitude, maximum velocity and period .a very simple solution is obtainedfor the limiting case of vanishinglysmall damping .  an approximate solutionby series in powers of dampingratio is worked out whichgives a satisfactory accuracy forquite large values of .
