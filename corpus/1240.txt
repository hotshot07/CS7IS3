nonsimilar solutions of the compressible laminar boundarylayer equations with applications to the upstream-transpirationcooling problem .  a new method is presented for predicting the boundary-layercharacteristics downstream of the porous region of aninjection-cooled surface .  the method consists of a general scheme forobtaining nonsimilar solutions of the compressible-laminar-boundary-layer equations and is formulated along the followinglines .  the viscous domain is divided into n curvilinear strips .the governing equations are then integrated along thecoordinate normal to the body from the surface to the boundary of eachstrip .  as a result, one obtains a set of independentintegro-differential relations .  the integration is carried out byexpressing the integrands as polynomials, the coefficients of whichare functions of the unknown values of the velocity andtemperature on the strip boundaries as well as of the imposedboundary condition at the wall and at the outer edge .  after theintegration is performed, a set of ordinary first-order differentialequations is obtained .  the set of equations may be solved forgiven initial conditions by a numerical integration scheme suchas the runge-kutta method .  several numerical examples ofinterest are presented .
