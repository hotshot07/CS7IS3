stresses in continuous skin stiffener panels under random loading .theoretical aspects involved in the prediction of stress levels forcontinuous skin-stiffener panels subjected to a random pressure fieldare considered in the light of powell's general theory for statisticalsuperposition of modal response . the choice of structural model isdictated by the prevalence of skin-stiffener construction in modernflight vehicle design . the present study clearly demonstrates that anytruly adequate prediction of stress levels in actual aircraft structures requires a much better representation of structural characteristicsthan can be provided by single panel idealizations . in an exampleconsidering fuselage panels exposed to jet engine noise, essentialagreement is shown with experimental data, although better correlation isshown for rms stress than for power spectrum . it is shown thatreduction of stress level by increasing damping is effective only in thehigher frequency range .
