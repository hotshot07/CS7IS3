Text: free-flight observation of a separated turbulent flowincluding heat transfer up to mach 8. 5.  a turbulent boundary layer separatedby a forward-facing step wasobserved on the cylindrical portionof a hemisphere-cone-cylinder testvehicle .  tip blunting, producing ashear flow, was found to inducehigher pressures on the cylindricalportion than were predicted fromballistic tunnel data of unblunted projectiles .an approximate method forpredicting this blunt-body pressuredistribution was hypothesized .  thesefindings, along with the hypothesis,were substantiated by a wind tunneltest of a similar body .  the peak pressureratios of the separation weresmaller in magnitude than flat platetheory predicted because of theeffect of the shear flow .  the decrementin heating of the separatedflow, relative to the correspondingattached flow, was found to comparewell with the expected results .
