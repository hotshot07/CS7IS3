on turbulent lubrication .the paper concerns the hydrodynamic turbulentmotion in the lubricant layer .  proceedingfrom the reynolds equations and introducingthe approximations currently used inlubrication problems, owing to the lubricant filmthickness, the general motion equations forturbulent lubrication are written .  using the prandtl mixing length hypothesis,exact and approximate solutions areobtained for the velocity distribution into thelubricant layer .  the results are discussed bypointing out the pressure gradient and thereynolds number influence on the velocitydistributions, as well as the differences withrespect to the laminar flow .  in order to obtain simple formulae, theexact dependence of the rate of flow on thepressure gradient into a dimensionless formis replaced by a linear relation, the slope ofwhich depends on the reynolds number .this approximation allows the obtainment ofthe pressure differential equation under asimple form .  the pressure equation is integratedin case of journal bearings, by assuming aconstant or a variable viscosity of the lubricant .  the results are compared to the experimentaldata obtained by m. i. smith and d. d.fuller and the good qualitative agreement is pointed out .
