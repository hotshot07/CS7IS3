Text: steady motion of conducting fluids in pipes under transversemagnetic fields .  this paper studies the steadymotion of an electrically conducting, viscous fluidalong channels in the presence of an imposedtransverse magnetic field when the walls do notconduct currents .  the equations which determinethe velocity profile, induced currents andfield are derived and solved exactly in the caseof a rectangular channel .  when the imposedfield is sufficiently strong the velocity profile isfound to degenerate into a core of uniform flowsurrounded by boundary layers on each wall .the layers on the walls parallel to the imposedfield are of a novel character .  an analogousdegenerate solution for channels of any symmetricalshape is developed .  the predicted pressuregradients for given volumes of flow at various fieldstrengths are finally compared with experimental results for square andcircular pipes .
