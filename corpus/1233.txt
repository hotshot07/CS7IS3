supersonic shear flow past an airfoil between two parallelwalls .  the supersonic flow with assigned mach number gradient inthe span direction past a straight wing between two parallelwalls is studied using the small-disturbance theory .  thegoverning equation for the disturbance pressure on the airfoil, togetherwith the boundary conditions on the airfoil and at the walls, issolved by the method of separation of variables .  uponseparation the problem is reduced to a sturm-liouville eigenvalueproblem and to the solution of the telegraph equation .  as an application, a certain mach number profile is selectedand the resulting pressure distribution on a parabolic arc airfoilis computed .
