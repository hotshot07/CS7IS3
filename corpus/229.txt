interference between the wings and tail surfaces ofa combination of slender body, cruciform wings andcruciform tail set at both incidence and yaw .  the interference between the wings and the tail surfaces of acombination of circular body, low aspect ratio cruciform wings andcruciform tail in an inviscid flow is analysed using the slender bodytheory .  the system may be subjected to both incidence and yaw and,in general, the tail fins may be staggered angularly with respect tothe main wings .  the method is a development of that used by owen and maskell inr.a.e. report no. aero.2441 to analyse similar effects on a system setat zero yaw .  simple expressions to determine the strengths and positions ofthe trailing vortices (supposed to be rolled-up) downstream of the mainwings are given, and from them the forces on the tail are deduced .when the tail surfaces are triangular and of low aspect ratio an exactsolution is obtained from slender body theory ..  but for rectangulartail surfaces of moderate or high aspect ratio, it is suggested that thechanges in lift and sideforce on the tail caused by the wing vortexfield can be estimated approximately from the mean upwash and sidewashangles evaluated over the respective tail spans .  formulae for thesemeans angles are presented .
