Text: reverse flow and variational theorems for lifting surfacesin nonstationary compressible flow .  a reverse-flow theorem for compressible nonsteady flow, validwithin the limits of linearized theory, is derived .  this theoremgives a general class of relations between linearized solutions forlifting surfaces in direct and reverse flow .  based on the sameconsiderations used to establish the theorem, an adjoint variationalprinciple, which may be useful in approximate solutions ofnon-steady lifting surface problems, is obtained .  to illustrate theuses of the reverse-flow theorem, it is applied to the determinationof relations between aerodynamic coefficients in direct andreverse flow and to the obtaining of influence functions for totallift, pitching moment, and rolling moment for a wing oscillatingwith arbitrary motion and surface deformation, in terms of thepressure distributions for simpler cases in reverse flow .
