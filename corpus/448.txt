Text: induction drag on a large negatively charged satellitemoving in a magnetic-field-free ionosphere .  an induction drag, experienced by acharged satellite during its traversal of theionosphere, has been theoretically postulated byseveral authors .  previous 'exact' treatmentsof the problem are inapplicable to large systems, andthe semiempirical approach of jastrowand pearse may yield somewhat questionable results .the present description initiallyconsiders the satellite as a completely permeable sphericalshell of charge, thus avoiding thedifficult boundary conditions introduced by the 'exact'linearized treatment .  the effects ofpermeability are then shown to be approximately removableby means of an iterative process .  afinal result, apparently valid to within an order ofmagnitude, is obtained for the drag forcearising solely from electrical effects .  its magnitudeis considerably less than that obtained byjastrow and pearse .
