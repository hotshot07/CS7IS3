some exact solutions for cavitating curvilinear bodies .  a special case of cavitating flow solutions ispostulated and transformed to a semi-infiniteplane .  the complete, exact solution then issynthesized by superposition of singularities .the solution is relevant to a general, two-parameterfamily of curvilinear bodies .  theparameters are the flow angles at the two points of flowseparation .  the body reduces, in the specialcase, to the rayleigh solution for a flat plate .the equations of the cavity boundaries aregiven in explicit form .  the body form and thestagnation streamline are given as the locus ofthe roots of a cubic equation .  local staticpressures and, hence, lift and drag, also may becalculated .  the generated solutions constitutea technique involving simple computationfor exact solutions of a special family of cavitatingcurvilinear bodies at finite angles of attack .
