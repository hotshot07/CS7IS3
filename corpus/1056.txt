Text: axisymmetric large deflections of circular plates subjectedto thermal and mechanical load .  this paper is concerned with the nonlinearaxisymmetric analysis of circular plates with in-planeedge restraint .  both temperature and mechanicalloads are accommodated as an extension ofinvestigations performed for the isothermal mechanicalloading problem .  an exact mathematicalformulation within the framework of the v. karman largestrain-displacement relations is developed .  theequilibrium equations and boundary conditions are thenderived by utilizing the calculus of variations forarbitrary axisymmetrical temperatures and normaldistributed loading .  the satisfaction of equilibrium andcompatibility equations requires the solution of twosimultaneous nonlinear ordinary differential equationssubject to the prescribed boundary conditions .analytical solutions of such equations are apparently notpossible and therefore numerical procedures must beemployed .  a finite difference procedure utilizing /relaxediterations,/ developed by h. keller and e. reiss, andemployed by them for the solution of isothermalproblems with apparently unlimited load parameter ranges,is used here for combined thermo-mechanical problems .numerical results are presented for the special case ofa simply supported circular plate with radiallyimmovable boundaries, subject to a uniform pressure and anarbitrary temperature variation through the thicknesstained for a large range of temperature and loadparameters .  however, because of space limitations, onlya limited amount of data are presented in this paper .
