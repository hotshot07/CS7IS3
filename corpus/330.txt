taylor instability of finite surface waves .the instability of the accelerated interfacebetween a liquid (methanol or carbontetrachloride) and air has been investigatedexperimentally for approximatesinusoidal disturbances of wave-number rangefrom well below to well above thecut-off .  the growth rates are measured andcompared with theoretical results .a third-order theory shows the phenomenaof overstability which is found in theexperimental results .  some measurementsof later stages of growth agreemoderately well with the available theoryand disclose some additionalphenomena of bubble competition, helmholtzinstability with transition to turbulence,and jet instability with production of drops .
