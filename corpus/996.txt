extension of boundary layer separation criteria toa m=6 .5 utilizing flat plates with forward-facingsteps .  an experimental investigation hasbeen made of the separationphenomena on a flat plate to whichforward-facing steps were attached toforce separation .  both laminar andturbulent flows were investigatedover a mach number range of approximatelydistributions, shadowgraph and chemicalfilm techniques, the pressurerise at separation, the laminar plateaupressure, and the turbulentpeak pressure were determined .boundary-layer surveys were made on asmooth flat plate and on a flat plate withroughness to forcetransition .  examinations of the separated flowshowed that the predominantvariable in the determination of the pressuredistribution was thelocation of transition relative to the separationpoint and reattachment .pure laminar, transitional, and turbulenttypes of separation were foundin this mach number range .  the peakstatic-pressure-rise ratios foridentical forward-facing steps at a machnumber of 6.25 wereapproximately 1.5 and 5.0, respectively, for purelaminar and turbulentseparation .  the effect of reynolds number on thepeak pressure rise forturbulent separation for the lower mach numberrange was found to be veryminor provided the step height was of theorder of the boundary-layerthickness .  as the mach number is increased,the peak pressurecoefficient for turbulent separation decreasedfrom approximately 0.18at a mach number of 4 to about 0.13 at a machnumber of 6.25 .  thepressure coefficient at the separation point forlaminar separation decreasesfrom approximately 0.014 at a mach number ofvalue at a mach number of 6.5 .  the resultsobtained with forward-facingsteps agree with the trends predicted, basedupon lower mach numberstudies .
