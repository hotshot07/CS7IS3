Text: on the behaviour of boundary layers at supersonic speeds .this paper considers the implications of recent advances in knowledge of the behaviour of boundary layers in supersonic flow . only the simplest case is considered-dashthat of the two-dimensional boundary layer on aflat plate, with nominal zero longitudinal pressure and temperaturegradients .it is shown that the empirical/intermediate enthalpy/used with successin approximations for skin friction, etc., of laminar boundary layers isclosely the same as the mean enthalpy with respect to velocity .furthermore, the mean enthalpics of laminar and turbulent boundarylayers may be the same . a nonrigorous approach is made to the problemsof self-induced pressure gradients, and the indications are that theireffects on laminar skin friction, etc., may become noticeable at machnumbers greater than 5 and they increase as the surface temperaturebuilds up towards zero heat-transfer conditions . the effects withturbulent boundary layers may not be so severe .finally, the results are applied to give an idea of the magnitude of thedrag and aerodynamic heating problems up to m 10, and one result isthat, if there is any conflict at the higher mach numbers betweensurface conditions required for high radiative emissivity and thosewhich may be thought necessary for preserving a laminar boundary layer,then it may be better to choose the former .
