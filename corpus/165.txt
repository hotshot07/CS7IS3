skin-friction measurements in incompressible flow .experiments have been conducted to measure inincompressible flow the local surface-shear stressand the average skin-friction coefficient for a turbulentboundary-layer on a smooth flat plate having zero pressure gradient .the local surface-shear stress was measured by a floating-elementskin-friction balance and also by a calibrated total headtube located on the surface of the test wall . theaverage skin-friction coefficient was obtained fromboundary-layer velocity profiles . theboundary-layer profiles were also used to determine the locationof the virtual origin of the turbulent boundary layer .data were obtainec for a range of reynolds numbersfrom 1 million to about 45 million with an attendantchange in mach number from 0.11 to 0.32 .   the measured local skin-friction coefficientsobtained with the floating-element balance agreewell with those of schultz-grunow and kempffor reynolds numbers up to 45 million . themeasured average skin-friction coefficients agreewith those given by the schoenherr curve in theranges of reynolds numbers from 1 to 3 millionand 30 to 45 million . in the range of reynoldsnumbers from 3 to 30 million the measured valuesare less than those predicted by the schoenherr        curve .the results show that the /univeral skin-friction constants/proposed by coles appraoch asymptoticallya constant value at reynolds numbers exceedingmentioned constants and the limited reynoldsnumber range of the present investigation, there is some doubtas to the validity of any turbulentskin-friction law written on the basis of the presentresults . hence, no new friction law is proposed .   the frictional resistance of a flat plate wascalculated by means of the momentum method andalso the integrated measured local surface shear .for reynolds numbers from 14 million to 45 millionboth methods give about the same result,. whereasat lower values of reynolds number the momentummethod based on velocity profiles uncorrected forthe effects of turbulence results in a frictionalresistance as much as 4 percent higher than thatof the integrated shear .the measurement of local surface shear by acalibrated preston tube appears to be accurateand inexpensive . the calibration as given bypreston must be modified slighlty, however, to yield theresults obtained from the floating-elementskin-friction balance .
