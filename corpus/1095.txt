investigation of effectiveness of large-chord slottedflaps in deflecting propeller slipstreams downwardfor vertical take-off and low-speed flight .  an investigation of the effectivenessof a wing equipped withlarge-chord slotted flaps in rotating thethrust vector of propellers throughthe angles required for verticaltake-off and for flight at very low speedshas been conducted in the facilitiesof the langley 300 mph 7- by 10-foottunnel .  under conditions of static thrustand with zero incidence between thethrust axis and the wing chord plane,the slotted flaps were effective inrotating the thrust vector upward aboutthan 10 percent of the thrust .  when anauxiliary vane was added above thewing, the thrust vector was rotated upwardconfiguration, vertical take-offcould be achieved with an initial attitudeof 16 and at airplane weightsup to 90 percent of the total propellerthrust .  the addition of 10incidence between the thrust axis and the wingincreased the upward rotationof the thrust vector about 10 .  for thesame turning angle, the divingmoments associated with the slotted-flapconfigurations were approximatelytwice as large as the diving moments ofthe configurations with plainflaps and two auxiliary vanes .
