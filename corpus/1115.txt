Text: measurements of aerodynamic forces for various meanangles of attack on an airfoil oscillating in pitchand on two finite-span wings oscillating in bendingwith emphasis on damping in the stall .  the oscillating air forces on a two-dimensional wingoscillating in pitch about the midchord have been measured at variousmean angles of attack and at mach numbers of 0.35 and 0.7 .the magnitudes of normal-force and pitching-moment coefficientswere much higher at high angles of attack than at low angles ofattack for some conditions .  large regions of negative dampingin pitch were found, and it was shown that the effect of increasingthe mach number from 0.35 to 0.7 was to decrease the initialangle of attack at which negative damping occurred .  measurements of the aerodynamic damping of a 10-percent-thick and of a 3-percent-thick finite-span wing oscillating inthe first bending mode indicate no regions of negative dampingfor this type of motion over the range of variables covered .  thedamping measured at high angles of attack was generally largerthan that at low angles of attack .
