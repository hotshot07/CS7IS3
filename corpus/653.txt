transient magnetohydrodynamic duct flow .  parallel flow of an electrically conducting viscousincompressible fluid in a rectangular duct withtransverse magnetic field is considered .  the wallsof the duct which are parallel and perpendicularto the imposed magnetic field are taken to benonconducting and perfectly conducting, respectively .assuming the fluid to be at rest at the initialmoment, exact solutions for the velocity and magneticfield components are obtained in the form ofconvolution integrals taking the longitudinal pressuregradient as an arbitrary given function of time .later, taking a step function for the pressure gradient,these expressions are integrated .  for this case,the effect of the strength of the imposed magneticfield on the development behavior of the flow isstudied .  it is found that except for very large magneticfields, the flows are over damped .
