Text: magnetohydrodynamics shocks .  a mathematical treatment of the coupled motion ofhydrodynamic flow and electromagnetic fields isgiven .  two simplifying assumptions are introduced ..  first,the conductivity of the medium is infinite, andsecond, the motion is described by a plane shock wave .various orientations of the plane of the shock andthe magnetic field are discussed separately, and theextreme relativistic and unrelativistic behavior isexamined .  special consideration is given to the behaviorof weak shocks, that is, of sound waves .  it isinteresting to note that the waves degenerate into commonsound waves and into common electromagneticwaves in the extreme cases of very weak and very strongmagnetic fields .
