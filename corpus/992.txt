Text: the effects of a small jet of air exhausting from the nose of a bodyof revolution in supersonic flow .an investigation has been made at a mach number of 1.62 to determinethe effects of a small jet of air exhausting from the nose of anelliptical body of revolution upon boundary-layer transition and theviscous, pressure, and total drag of the forebody at three body stationsbody nose were also obtained . the tests were conducted at reynoldsnumbers of 2.13 x 10 and 7.66 x 10, based on body length . the maximumrange of thrust coefficients for the small jet was from 0 to aboutat the lower test reynolds number, for which the boundary layer waslaminar over the entire body in the jet-off condition, a very small flow from the jet moved the point of transition forward to the vicinity ofthe 20-percent-body station . as the jet flow was increased, thetransition point moved abruptly to the nose at a thrust coefficient of aboutgardless of the type of boundary layer . at the higher test reynoldsnumber for which the boundary layer was largely turbulent in the jet-off condition the total drag, including skin friction, was reduced somewhat by the action of the jet .although the forward-exhausting small jet was found to have the abovefavorable effects upon the drag, these findings are not believed tooimportant since the question arises as to the benefits of the same small jet exhausting from the rear of the body in the conventional manner .no attempt was made to establish geometric optimums in the presentinvestigation, yet, from a general consideration of the benefitsindicated by the present results and the phenomena known to occur in thevicinity of rearward-exhausting jets, the benefits of a small jetexhausting rearward would appear to exceed those of the same small jetexhausting forward, particularly so when the flow over the body islaminar in the jet-off condition .
