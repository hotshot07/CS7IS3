Text: analysis of stresses in the elements of shell structure .the love-meissner analysis for thin shells has previously been appliedto cones of uniform wall thickness, and solutions for the stressresultants were given in terms of kelvin's functions . sincetabulation of these functions for large arguments is not practical,considerable computation was still required .  in the present paper, the authorsdefine special functions which eliminate the necessity of evaluatingkelvin/s functions and which may be used with simple algebraic andtrigonometric functions to compute the boundary forces and displacementsfor cones for various loading conditions .  these special functions alsomake clear the magnitude of errors which result from geckeler/s andother approximate solutions .
