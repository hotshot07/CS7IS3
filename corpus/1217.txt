application of inequality constraints to variationalproblems of lifting re-entry .  inequality constraints are introduced into the variationalformulation of the optimum re-entry problem for a liftingvehicle to prevent human and or structural tolerances from beingexceeded .  these constraints consist of minimum and maximumangle of attack, maximum load factor, and maximum convectiveheat transfer (equilibrium temperature) .  the equations have been programed for the ibm 704computer, and sample trajectories are presented for which the totalheat transferred to certain critical areas on the windwardsurface of the vehicle is minimized .  these trajectories indicate thedominant effect of the constraints on the optimum flight path,which is shown to consist of both unconstrained and constrainedarcs .
