flutter of aerodynamically heated aluminium-alloy andstainless steel panels with length-width ratio of 10at mach 3. 0.  an investigation of the effects of aerodynamic heating on theflutter of multibay external-skin panels has been carried out at a machnumber of 3.0 in the langley 9- by 6-foot thermal structures tunnel .  bothaluminum-alloy and 17-7 ph stainless-steel panels with a length-widthratio of 10 for each bay were tested at dynamic pressures betweenaddition, a few tests were made on the lower vertical stabilizer of thex-15 airplane which has external-skin panels unsupported for a length  all panels showed flutter boundaries characterized by an increasein panel thickness required to prevent flutter with increasing thermallyinduced stress prior to buckling .  after buckling the panels showedflutter boundaries characterized by a decrease in thickness required toprevent flutter with further increases in thermal stress .  the largestthickness required to prevent flutter in the presence of aerodynamicheating occurred at the transition between the flat-panel boundary andthe buckled-panel boundary .  this peak value (for aluminum-alloy panel)was as much as 60 percent greater than the extrapolated value for anunheated, unloaded panel .  values of the modified-thickness-ratio flutter parameter for theunstressed panels (obtained by extrapolation) were in fair agreement forthe aluminum, steel, and x-15 stabilizer panels .  peak values attransition, however, showed large differences due to apparently minorchanges in panel-support construction and or changes in panel-skinmaterial .
