low speed tests on 45 sweptback wings .  this report contains the resultsof pressure measurements on threeand aspect ratio 5, over anincidence range up to 10 .  chordwiseand spanwise lift distributionsare given, mostly near the centrewhere, on two of the wings,modifications had been made to the sectionshape .  it was found that alteringthe thickness distribution in thecentre did not affect the loading butthat approximately straight isobarscould be obtained at values ofbelow about 0.1 .  by the incorporationof twist and camber in the centralpart the distortion of the liftdistribution in the centre could beavoided at one particular incidence,and thus the same chordwisedistribution obtained over most of the span .  twist and camber alone do not improvethe isobar pattern andtherefore a thickness modification would beneeded to give the desiredlift distribution and isobar pattern at oneparticular incidence .  the results of experimental investigationsof the boundary layerand of the effect of aspect ratio will be givenin a later report .
