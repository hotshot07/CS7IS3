Text: interaction of a charged satellite with the ionosphere .  the problem of the ion density distribution around acharged satellite has been treated by a numerical methodwhich does not require linearization of the equations orrestriction to infinitesimal objects .  however, magnetic fieldeffects were not considered, and a number of othersimplifying assumptions were required .  some sample calculationsfor spherical satellites are presented, illustrating thegeneral character of the satellite wake .  calculations of theso-called /charge drag/ were also made, yielding resultsqualitatively similar to those previously obtained by jastrow and pearse .
