aerodynamic processes in the downwash-impingement problem .  theoretical and experimental data relating to the downwashimpingement problem are examined in order to arrive at acoherent understanding of the process of entrainment of groundparticles in the flow .  it is demonstrated that a key mechanismin the process is the interaction of nonuniform flow in the groundboundary layer with bluff ground particles .  this interactionproduces a lift force which, under typical conditions, equals orexceeds the particle weight .  in the interest of quantitative prediction of the conditionsnecessary for particle entrainment, four subsidiary problem areasin the impinging jet are examined .  these are the viscous decay,the inviscid flow field, the ground boundary layer, and the forceson a bluff body in nonuniform flow .  applicable theories areused in conjunction with experimental data to assess the accuracyand range of validity of the theories, and to define the streamconditions which will cause particle entrainment .  available data are applied to the establishment of criteria forparticle entrainment in the vicinity of the impinging-jetstagnation point .  these criteria show that entrainment occurs in afinite annular region on the ground plane, and that the particlesmost readily entrained are those with a diameter equal to abouttwo-thirds the thickness of the ground boundary layer .  theconfiguration size is shown to influence the process in that theonset of entrainment is fixed by the jet diameter and velocity,and the size of the ground particles .  the criteria establishedprovide a quantitative estimate of the conditions causingentrainment and provide a basis for scaling experimental results toa variety of full-scale situations .
