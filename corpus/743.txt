new developments in the nonlinear theories of the buckling of thincylindrical shells .in the present paper a short survey will be given first of the bucklingand postbuckling behavior of isotropic cylindrical shells subjectedto different loading conditions as obtained by the nonlinear theoryof finite deflections of shells during the last twenty years .next a report will be given on new investigations carried out in thestructures department of the dvl concerning the elastic stability ofisotropic and orthotropic cylindrical shells loaded in axial compressionand internal pressure .  these studies are based on the nonlinear theoryof finite deformations .  the theoretical rsults will be compared withnew experimental results obtained with a series of axially loadedpressurized isotropic and orthotropic cylindrical shells .
