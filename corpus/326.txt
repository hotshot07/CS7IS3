forst-order slip effects on the compressible laminarboundary layer over a slender body of revolution inaxial flow .analysis of thecompressible boundary layer with transverse curvature in firstorder slip flow .  no boundary-layer interaction effects are consideredand only the zero pressure-gradient case is examined .
