Text: flutter of rectangular simply supported panels at highsupersonic speeds .  the problem of panel flutter of rectangular simply supportedplates subjected to supersonic flow over one surface is treatedtheoretically .  the assumption is made, and subsequentlyverified, that the /static/ approximation to the aerodynamic flutterforces yields flutter boundaries with satisfactory accuracy formach numbers greater than about 2 .  two panel flutter analysesare performed using this static approximation in conjunction withthin-plate theory--one employs aerodynamic strip theory, theother aerodynamic surface theory .  the influence of machnumber, dynamic pressure, panel aspect ratio, and midplanestress on the panel thickness required to prevent flutter isdetermined for extensive ranges of these parameters .
