Text: transformation of the compressible turbulent boundarylayer .  the transformation of the compressible turbulent boundary-layer equations to their incompressible equivalent isdemonstrated analytically .  the transformation is essentially the sameas that for the laminar layer, first given by stewartson, exceptthat the explicit relation between the viscosity and temperatureis not required .  a key point in the analysis is the modificationof the stream function to include a mean of the fluctuatingcomponents and the postulate that the apparent turbulent shear,associated with an elemental mass, remains invariant in thetransformation .  the values of the incompressible friction coefficients and ofpressure rise causing separation thus transformed show goodagreement with the experimentally measured and independentlyreported results .  an application of the transformation to theself-preserving boundary layers and to the computations ofgeneral boundary-layer flow is shown .
