Text: physical properties of plastics for photo-thermoelasticinvestigation .  the optical and physical properties ofparaplex p43, castolite, and epoxy resinhysol 6000-op, which are potentially ofinterest in photothermoelastic investigations,were investigated over a temperature rangefrom +100 to -60 f .  results on thethermal-expansion coefficient, the materialfringe value, and the modulus of elasticityas functions of temperature are presented .also evaluated were thermal properties ofimportance in heat conduction .  photothermoelasticfigures of merit, which rate theoptical sensitivity of materials in photothermoelasticapplications, as well as a newmethod to determine this figure in a relative manner are presented .
