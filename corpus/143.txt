interplanetary orbits .  the basic equations under simplifiedconditions for interplanetary flight are derived .for a voyage from planet to planet anunlimited number of orbits is possible .  inorder to give a clear survey of these possibleorbits a diagram is developed from which theapproximate energy-requirement, the duration,and other particulars of a voyage can beeasily found .
