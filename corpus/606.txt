formulae and approximations for aerodynamic heating rates in high speedflight .this note gives formulae and approximations suitable for makingpreliminary estimates of aerodynamic heating rates in high speed flight .the formulae are based on the /intermediate enthalpy/ approximationwhich has given good agreement with theoretical and experimentalevidence . in the general flight case they could be used in conjunction with an analogue computer or a step-by-step method of integration topredict the variations of heat flow and skin temperature with time .in the restricted case of flight at constant altitude and mach number,simple analytical methods and results are given which include theeffects of radiation and can be applied to /thick/ as well as /thin/ skinswhere h is the aerodynamic heat transfer factor, and g, d and k are theheat capacity, thickness and thermal conductivity of the skin . if 0.1the skin is approximately /thin/, i.e. temperature gradients across itsthickness may be neglected .
