the bending stability of thin-- walled unstiffenedcircular cylinders including the effects of internalpressure .  in a recent paper, the authors presented a statistical,semiempirical design procedure for the determination of the bucklingstrength of unpressurized and pressurized cylinders under axialcompression .  this procedure has been extended in the presentpaper to the bending of unpressurized and pressurized cylindricalshells and allows the calculation of the critical bending stress witha knowledge of the cylinder geometry and the internal pressureonly .  because no published data could be found, an extensive seriesof bending tests of pressurized cylinders has been performed .these new data for pressurized cylinders are treatedsemiempirically together with all of the other known test data forunpressurized cylinders .  best-fit curves are presented using applicabletheoretical parameters .  design curves for determining thecritical buckling stress for unpressurized and pressurized cylindersin bending are then developed as 90 per cent probability curvesfrom the test data .
