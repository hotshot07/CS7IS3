Text: secondary flow fields embedded in hypersonic shocklayers .  when a ramp or other compressionsurface is located in a locallysupersonic region behind a hypersonicbow shock wave, it generates asecondary shock wave .  the ramp flowdisturbance may be viewed as anembedded newtonian impact flow if theembedded shock layer is thin .examination of the applicability of newtonianflow theory to cones and wedgesin uniform streams suggests that thistheory can be expected to give auseful approximation to the surfacepressures .  a pressure equation based on thisconcept predicts a number ofinteresting things ..  first, pressurescan differ from simple newtoniantheory by factors of 1 5 to 3,. forexample, on flare stabilizers onblunt-nosed bodies of revolution, pressuresare lower than newtonian and diminishwith increasing flight speed in thehypersonic speed range .  the calculatedpressures vary over the flare surfaceas a result of the nonuniformity ofits incident stream, and depend on theaxial location of the flare .  inthe case of a flap mounted on alarge-angled blunt-nosed cone, the pressurecoefficients vary from 1 to 5 throughthe variable entropy layer .  apressure coefficient of 5 greater thanthe maximum possible in newtonianflow can occur because the compressionprocess is more efficient than asingle shock wave process .  on areasof the flap that protrude throughthe main bow wave, the pressurecoefficient should revert to the simplenewtonian value .  equations are developed for theinitial slopes of the normal-forceand pitching-moment curves of a flarestabilizer .  in the simplest casethese differ from conventional newtoniantheory by the ratio of localdynamic pressure to free-stream dynamicpressure .  this ratio takes valuesas low as 0.1 in some of the examples considered .
