experimental investigation at mach number of 3. 0 ofeffects of thermal stress and buckling on flutter characteristicsof flat single-bay panels of length-width ratio 0. 96 .  flat, single-bay, skin stiffenerpanels with length-width ratios of 0.96were tested at a mach number of 3.0,at dynamic pressures ranging from 1,500 tostagnation temperatures from 300 f toeffects of thermal stress and buckling on theflutter of such panels .  the panelsupporting structure allowed partial thermalexpansion of the skins in both thelongitudinal and lateral directions .  panelskin material and skin thickness were varied .  a boundary faired through theexperimental flutter points consisted of aflat-panel portion, a buckled-panelportion, and a transition point, at theintersection of the two boundaries,where a panel is most susceptible to flutter .the flutter region consisted of twofairly distinct sections, a large-amplitudeflutter region and a small-amplitudeflutter region .  the results show that anincrease in panel skin temperatureflutter .  the flutter trend for buckledpanels is reversed .  use of a modifiedtemperature parameter, which approximatelyaccounts for the effects of differentialpressure and variations in panel skinmaterial and skin thickness, reduced thescatter in the data which resulted whenthese effects were neglected .  the resultsare compared with an exact theory forclamped panels for the condition of zeromidplane stress .  in addition, atwo-mode /transtability/ solution for clampedpanels is compared with theexperimentally determined transition point .
