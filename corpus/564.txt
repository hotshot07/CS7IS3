local heat transfer and recovery temperature on a yawedcylinder at a mach number of 4. 15 and high reynoldsnumbers .  local heat transfer, equilibrium temperatures,and wall static pressures have been measured on acircular cylinder at yaw angles of 0, 10, 20, 40,and 60 .  the reynolds number range of the testswas from 1x10 to 4x10 based on cylinderdiameter .  increasing the yaw angle from 0 to 40 increasedthe stagnation-line heat-transfer coefficients by 100to 180 percent .  a further increase in yaw angle toheat-transfer coefficients .  at zero yaw angle the boundary layer over theentire front half of the cylinder was laminar but atyaw angles of 40 and 60 it was evidently completelyturbulent, including the stagnation line, asdetermined by comparison of local heat-transfer coefficientswith theoretical predictions .  the level of heatingrates and the nature of the chordwise distributionof heat transfer indicated that a flow mechanismdifferent from the conventional transitional boundarylayer may have existed at the intermediate yaw anglesof 10 and 20 .  at all yaw angles the peakheat-transfer coefficient occurred at the stagnation lineand the chordwise distribution of heat-transfercoefficient decreased monotonically from this peak .  the average heat-transfer coefficients over thefront half of the cylinder are in agreement withprevious data for a comparable reynolds numberrange .  the theoretical heat-transfer distributions forboth laminar and turbulent boundary layers arecalculated directly from simple quadrature formulasderived in the present report .
