Text: an investigation of some aspects of the sonic boomby means of wind tunnel measurements of pressures aboutseveral bodies at a mach number of 2. 01 .  an investigation of some aspectsof the sonic boom has been madewith the aid of wind-tunnel measurementsof the pressure distributionsabout bodies of various shapes .  thetests were made in the langleyat a mach number of 2.01 andat a reynolds number per foot of 2.5 x 10 .measurements of the pressurefield were made at orifices in the surfaceof a boundary-layer bypassplate .  the models which represented bothfuselage and wing types ofthickness distributions were small enoughto allow measurements as faraway as 8 body lengths or 64 chords .  theresults are compared withestimates made using existing theory .  to the first order, the boom-producingpressure rise across the bowshock is dependent on the longitudinaldevelopment of body area and noton local details .  nonaxisymmetrical shapesmay be replaced byequivalent bodies of revolution to obtain satisfactorytheoretical estimatesof the far-field pressures .
