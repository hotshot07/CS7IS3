on structural fatigue under random loading .  experience has shown that the fluctuating loads induced by ajet may cause fatigue failure of aircraft structural components .in order to throw some light on this and similar problems, thestress spectrum and the /equivalent fatigue stress/ of an elasticstructure subjected to random loading are studied .  the analysisis simplified by assuming the structure to have only a singledegree of freedom and by using the concept of cumulative damage,the results being expressed in terms of quantities that can bedirectly measured .  as an example, a similarity expression forthe probable value of the equivalent fatigue stress of a panelsubjected to jet buffeting is derived .
