Text: flutter tests of some simple models at a mach numberof 7. 2 in helium flow .  results of hypersonic fluttertests on some simple models arepresented .  the models had rectangularplan forms of panel aspect ratio 1.0,no sweepback, and bending-to-torsionfrequency ratios of about .  twoairfoil sections were included in thetests ,. double wedges of 5-, 10-,and 15-percent thickness and flat plateswith straight, parallel sidesand beveled leading and trailing edges .the models were supported by acantilevered shaft .  the double-wedge wings were testedin helium at a mach number of 7.2 .an effect of airfoil thickness on flutterspeed was found, thicker wingsrequiring more stiffness to avoid flutter .a few tests in air at a machnumber of 6.9 showed the same thicknesseffect and also indicated thattests in helium would predict conservativeflutter boundaries in air .the data in air and helium seemed to becorrelated by piston-theorycalculations .  piston-theory calculationsagreed well with experiment forthe thinner models but began to deviateas the thickness parameterapproached and exceeded 1.0 .  a few tests on flat-plate modelswith various elastic-axis locationswere made .  piston-theory calculationswould not satisfactorily predictthe flutter of these models, probablybecause of their blunt leadingedges .
