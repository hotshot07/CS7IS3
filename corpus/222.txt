Text: the flow over delta wings at low speeds with leadingedge separation .  a low speed investigation of the flow over a 40 apex angle deltawing with sharp leading edges has been made in order to ascertaindetails of the flow in the viscous region near the leading edge of thesuction surface of the wing .  a physical picture of the flow wasobtained from the surface flow and a smoketechnique of flow visualization,combined with detailed measurements of totalhead, dynamic pressure, flowdirections and vortex core positions in the flow above the wing .  surface pressure distributions were also measured and integratedto give normal force coefficients .  the results of this investigation were compared with those of otherexperimental investigations and also with various theoretical results .in particular, the normal force coefficients, vortex core positions andattachment line positions were compared with the theoretical results ofmangler and smith, reference 19 .  it was found that ..exist on the upper surface of the wing outboard of and belowthe main vortices .  these secondary vortices are formed as aresult of separation of the boundary layers developing outboardof the top surface attachment lines .
