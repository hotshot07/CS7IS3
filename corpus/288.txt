Text: the rolling up of the trailing vortex sheet and itseffect on the downwash behind wings .  the motion of the trailing vortices associated with a lifting wingis investigated by theoretical and visual-flow methods for thepurpose of determining the proper vortex distribution to be usedfor downwash calculations .  both subsonic and supersonic speedsare considered in the analysis .  it is found that the degree to which the vortices are rolled updepends upon the distance behind the wing and upon the liftcoefficient, span loading, and aspect ratio of the wing .  while therolling up of the trailing vortices associated with highaspect-ratio wings is of little practical importance, it is shown that, withlow-aspect-ratio wings, the trailing vortex sheet may becomeessentially rolled up into two trailing vortex cores within a chordlength of the trailing edge .  the downwash fields associated with the two limiting cases ofthe flat vortex sheet and the fully rolled-up vortices areinvestigated in detail for both subsonic and supersonic speeds .  theintermediate case in which the rolling-up process is only partiallycompleted at the tail position is also discussed .
