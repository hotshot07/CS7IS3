an investigation of optimum zoom climb techniques .  the problem of optimal zoom climb maneuvering of a turbojetaircraft has been investigated using the mayer formulation of thecalculus of variations .  the euler-lagrange equations governingoptimum symmetric flight have been integrated numerically bydigital computation .  discontinuities in thrust arising from turbojet afterburnerblowout have been treated, and conditions which must besatisfied across the interface generated by the discontinuity have beenderived .  arbitrary control techniques have been compared with theoptimum, and it has been found that performance is relativelyinsensitive to piloting technique unless a time limitation isimposed which requires high maneuvering load factors .
