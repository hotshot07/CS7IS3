Text: analytic determination of discharge coefficients of flow nozzles .integration of the velocity profile at the throat of a flow nozzleyields the discharge coefficient as a function of the ratio of boundarysolution of the approximate momentum equation for the boundary layer .the resulting expression for the discharge coefficient is then afunction of the reynolds number based on nozzle diameter and of the geometry of the nozzle . good agreement is shown between this expression andpublished experimental data on flow nozzles for reynolds numbers between
