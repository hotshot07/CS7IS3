Text: subsonic aerodynamic flutter derivatives for wings and control surfaces, /compressible and incompressible flow/ .this report gives tables of the two-dimensional subsonic flutterderivatives,. where possible the values given are based on the published work of various authors, but some have been specially calculated forthis report . wing derivatives are given for mach numbers 0, 0.5, 0.6and 0.7 for the frequency parameter range 0 /0.04/ 0.2 /0.2/ 1.6 andmach numbers 0 and 0.7 for frequency parameter 5.0 . control surfacederivatives are given for mach numbers 0 and 0.7 for control surface/wing chord ratios 0.02 /0.02/ 0.10 /0.05/ 0.50 and frequency parametersare also given for mach numbers 0, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 for frequencyparameter 0 /0.04/ 0.2 /0.2/ 1.4 . control surface-tab derivatives aregiven for some particular values of the variables and methods ofobtaining approximate values of these derivatives for other values ofthe variables are suggested . control surface and tab derivatives are in all cases for no aerodynamic balance .
