experimental study of the velocity and temperaturedistribution in a high-velocity vortex-type flow .  the vortex tube represents a simple device in which aparticular type of vortex motion may be studied in thelaboratory in an attempt to obtain a better understandingof such flows .  such an investigation has been pursued inthe heat transfer laboratory of the university ofminnesota .  the present paper summarizes the major results ofthis vortex-tube investigation .
