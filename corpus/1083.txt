an investigation of fluid flow in two dimensions .flow of an inviscid fluid . -dash there are in existence several methods of obtaining numerical solutions to the two-dimensional flow of aperfect fluid for given boundary conditions . part 2 of the present papergives a method of obtaining a numerical solution for viscous steady flowsolution of the simpler problem, illustrating it with examples bearingon the experimental work described in part iv .
