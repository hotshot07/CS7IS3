experimental investigation of attenuation of strongshock waves in a shock tube with hydrogen and heliumas driver gases .  an experimental investigationhas been made of the attenuation ofstrong shock waves in air in a shocktube .  time-history measurementswere made of the static pressure atseveral stations in the wall of thetube .  the internal diameter of thetube is 3.75 inches .  shock-wave-velocity data were taken for a distancealong the tube of about 120 feet .the range of the shock-wave mach numbercovered was from 5 to 10 andthe initial pressure ahead of the shockwave varied from 5 to 100millimeters of mercury .  hydrogen and heliumwere used as driver gases .  a helium-driven shock wave was foundto decay only about one-halfas rapidly as a hydrogen-driven shock wave .the pressure level hadlittle effect on the attenuation rate ofa shock wave of given strengthfor the pressure range investigated .  thestatic-pressure measurementsindicated that a severe pressure gradientexisted in the latter portionof the air flow .  this gradient limits thetesting time useful forobtaining reliable aerodynamic data .
