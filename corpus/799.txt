some effects of wind-tunnel interference observed in tests ontwo-dimensional aerofoils at high subsonic and transonic speeds .in the high-speed research on two-dimensional aerofoils at the nationalphysical laboratory the need to keep model size above a certain minimum, in order to reproduce correctly the boundary layer separation effectsexperienced at full scale, has been considered paramount even at therisk of incurring significant tunnel interference effects .this report discusses the interference effects for the slotted workingsections now in use . the magnitudes of the blockage and lift effectcorrections are deduced for the ratio of model chord to tunnel heightnormally used . it is shown that a simple adaptation to reduce the openarea of the walls would reduce both corrections to insignificantproportions simultaneously, but would give a reduced choking mach numberseparated flows . the observed trends in the variation of the blockageeffects for other ratios of model chord to tunnel height differ fromthose predicted theoretically, and so the results cannot be applied more generally until these trends have been checked by furtherinvestigations .it is suggested that wake interference effects can significantlyinfluence the manner in which separated flows develop with increasingincidence or mach number, particularly for walls of small open area .examples are also given of effects of distortions in the localsupersonic flow, which are most noticeable for walls with relatively largeopen areas .
