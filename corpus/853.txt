Text: the accuracy of donnell's equations .  solutions of donnell's equations of the smalldeformations of the perfectly elastic thin-walled circularcylindrical shell are compared with those obtainable from flugge'sequations .  the range of the basic parameters is foundwithin which the two solutions are approximately equal .
