on som reciprocal relations in the theory of nonstationary flows .in the theory of nonstationary flows about airfoils, the /indicial lift/ function k /s/ of wagner and the /alternating lift/ function c /k/ oftheodorsen have fundamental significance . this paper reports on someinteresting relations of the nature of fourier transforms that existbetween these functions . general problems in transient flows aboutairfoils may be given a unified broad treatment when these functions are employed . certain approximate results also are reported which are ofnotable simplicity, and an analogy with transient electrical flows isdrawn .
