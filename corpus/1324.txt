Text: the effect on transition of isolated surface excrescencesin the boundary layer .  the effect of isolated surface excrescences in alaminar boundary layer in producing disturbanceswhich may lead to turbulent flow has been examinedexperimentally by several methods .  photographs of someof the flow patterns visualised by smoke and china-claytechniques are given .  the critical heights of pimple which just give rise tospreading wedges of turbulent flow have been measuredon a flat plate and on two aerofoils at several angles ofincidence .  the results are analysed and are presented in aform which enables approximate estimates to be made of theprotuberances permissible on laminar-flow surfaces atfull-scale flight reynolds numbers .  the estimates suggestthat at an altitude of 30,000 ft the critical pimple heightis 0.004 in. for a speed of 350 m.p.h., whilst 0.002 in.may be permissible at all subsonic speeds .  at sea-level,however, the tolerances are approximately halved .
