cruise performance of channel-flow ground effect machines .  the performance theory for high-speed air-cushion vehiclesoperating in close proximity to the ground is developed .  theanalysis is restricted to cruise flight of vehicles of rectangularplanform employing an air pressure seal between the ground andthe vehicle along the two streamwise sides .  the variation ofthe optimum rearward deflection angle of the side jet pressureseal with speed for minimum overall power expenditure andmaximum range is found .  it is concluded that a mixedpropulsion system (jet deflection plus propeller(s)) is required .volume flow and the corresponding fan pressure rise needed arealso calculated .  the maximum lift drag ratio is determined .  the maximum thickness ratios of the vehicles are consideredto be large compared with the ground-height vehicle-lengthratio .  two-dimensional airfoil theory is employed to show thatclose to stagnation conditions exist below the vehicles .  thelower-surface lift, pitching moment, and aerodynamic-centerlocation are determined .  the flow over the upper surface is identified with flow overmounds .  upper-surface lift coefficients are determined fortypical mound shapes .  it is shown that high total lift coefficients are theoreticallyobtainable with almost zero induced drag .  the conventionalinduced-drag power penalty is replaced by a sealing-air powerexpenditure, which is shown not to be excessive .
