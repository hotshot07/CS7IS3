Text: the generation of noise by isotropic turbulence .a finite region, with fixed boundaries, of aninfinite expanse of compressible fluid is inturbulent motion .  this motion generates noiseand radiates it into the surrounding fluid .the acoustic properties of the system are studiedin the special case in which the turbulentregion consists of decaying isotropic turbulence .it is assumed that the reynolds numberof the turbulence is large, and that the mach number is small .  the noise appears to be generated mainlyby those eddies of the turbulence whosecontribution to the rate of dissipation of kineticenergy by viscosity is negligible .  it is shown that the intensity of sound at largedistances from the turbulence is the sameas that due to a volume distribution of simple acousticsources occupying the turbulent region .in this analogy, the whole fluid is to be regardedas a stationary and uniform acousticmedium .  the local value of the acoustic power outputp per mass of turbulent fluid is givenapproximately by the formulawhere a is a numerical constant, u is themean-square velocity fluctuation, is the time, andc is the velocity of sound in the fluid .  theconstant a is expressed in terms of the well-knownvelocity correlation function f(r) byassuming the joint probability distribution of theturbulent velocities and their first twotime-derivatives at two points in space to begaussian .  the numerical value isthen obtained by substituting the form of f(r)corresponding to heisenberg's theoreticalspectrum of isotropic turbulence .  it is found that the effects of decay makeonly a small contribution to the value of a, andthat the order of magnitude of a is not changedwhen widely differing forms of the functionf(r) are used .
