Text: tables of exact laminar-boundary layer solutions whenthe wall is porous and fluid properties are variable .  the three partial differential equations of the laminar boundarylayer for two-dimensional steady-state compressible flow have beentransformed into two ordinary differential equations by the method ofpohlhausen, falkner, and skan .  the ordinary equations includeparameters for expressing the simultaneous effects of pressure gradient inthe main-stream flow through a porous wall and property changes in thefluid due to large temperature differences between the wall and thefree stream .  a total of 58 cases have been solved numerically by the method ofpicard .  the euler number (nondimensional pressure-gradient parameter)ranges in value from 1 (stagnation-point value) to the negative valuesfound at the laminar separation points .  three rates of flow throughthe porous wall were considered (including the impermeable case wherethe flow rate is 0) .  five temperature ratios (stream temperaturedivided by wall temperature) were used ..  the uncooled and unheatedcase (temperature ratio of 1), two cooled cases (temperature ratios ofture ratios of and ) .  velocity, weight-flow, and temperaturedistributions are tabulated as are the dimensionless stream function offalkner and skan and its derivatives and the dimensionless temperaturefunction of pohlhausen and its derivatives .  for each case, displacement, momentum, and convection thicknesses,as well as nusselt number and coefficient of friction at the wall, werecomputed .
