free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic .





free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic .  charts have been prepared relating the thermodynamic properties ofair in chemical equilibrium for temperatures to 15,000 k and forpressures from 10 to 10 atmospheres .  also included are charts showingthe composition of air, the isentropic exponent, and the speed ofsound .  these charts are based on thermodynamic data calculated by thenational bureau of standards .
