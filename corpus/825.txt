Text: inelastic instability and incremental theories of plasticity .  a most troublesome paradox has existed for a number of yearswith respect to buckling in the plastic range .  theoreticalconsiderations and all direct experimental evidence showconclusively that an incremental or flow type of mathematical theoryof plasticity is valid .  however, the results of plastic bucklingtests are well correlated by a simple total or deformation theoryand bear no resemblance to published predictions of incrementaltheory .  the suggestion was made that initial imperfections of shapeor loading might well explain this most peculiar result .however, subsequent investigations by several authors seem to havegiven the impression that excessively large imperfections wouldbe needed and that the answer would be overly sensitive to themagnitude of such imperfections .  it is the purpose of this paper to demonstrate that extremelysmall, and therefore unavoidable, imperfections of shape doaccount for the paradox in a simple manner .  the buckling load isshown to be extremely insensitive to the amount of imperfection .the example chosen is a simplified version of the long rectangularplate hinged along one edge and free on the other underuniform compressive stress at the ends .  this is the equivalent ofthe case of the cruciform column, which has been so disturbingin the past because incremental theory applied to a perfectcruciform column did lead to an entirely incorrect result .
