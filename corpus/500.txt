joule heating in magnetohydrodynamic free-convectionflows .  the steady, fully developed, laminar, free-convection flow of anelectrically conducting fluid between two fully submergedopen-ended, constant-temperature vertical plates located in a constant,uniformly distributed, transverse magnetic field has been analyzedwith the joule heating term retained in the energy equation .analytic results are obtained .  such analytic results are useful inestimating the actual magnitude of the influence of joule heating aswell as a qualitative description of the manner in which it altersthe temperature and flow fields .  the present result confirms theusual practice that the influence of joule heating is negligiblysmall .
