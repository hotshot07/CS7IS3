comparative tests of pitot-static tubes .  comparative tests were made on seven conventionalpitot-static tubes to determine their static, dynamic, andresultant errors .  the effect of varying the dynamicopening, static openings, wall thickness, and inner-tubediameter was investigated .  pressure-distribution measurementsshowing stem and tip effects were also made .  a tentativedesign for a standard pitot-static tube for use inmeasuring air velocity is submitted .  this report covers an investigation conducted underthe auspices of the national research council .
