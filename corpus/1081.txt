numerical solution of the navier-stokes equations for the flow around acircular cylinder at reynolds number 40 .the steady two-dimensional flow around a circular cylinder submerged ina viscous fluid for the case r 40 is investigated, integratingnumerically the exact navier-stokes equations . the main results are asfollows . /i/ the steady flow solution exists even for the reynoldsnumber as high as 40 . moreover, it seems that the solution goes oversmoothly to the solution of the kirchhoff discontinuous flow theorywhich seems to be the limiting flow for the case r . /ii/ the flowpattern and the coefficients of pressure and drag are in good agreementwith the experimental data .
