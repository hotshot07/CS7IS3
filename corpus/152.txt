on the flow of compressible fluid past an obstacle .

lord rayleigh, o.m., f.r.s.



on the flow of compressible fluid past an obstacle .it is well known that according to classical hydrodynamics a steadystream of frictionless incompressible fluid exercises no resultantforce upon an obstacle, such as a rigid sphere, immersed in it .  thedevelopment of a /resistance/ is usually attributed to viscosity, orwhen there is a sharp edge to the negative pressure which may accompanyit (helmholtz) .  in either case it would seem that resistance involvessomething of the nature of a wake, extending behind the obstacle to aninfinite distance .  when the system of disturbed velocities, althoughit may mathematically extend to infinity, remains as it were attached tothe obstacle, there can be no resistance .the absence of resistance is asserted for an incompressible fluid., butit can hardly be supposed that a small degree of compressibility, as inwater, would affect the conclusion .  on the other hand, high relativevelocities, exceeding that of sound in the fluid, must entirely alterthe conditions .  it seems worth while to examine this question moreclosely, especially as the first effects of compressibility are amenableto mathematical treatment .
