measurements of skin friction of the compressible turbulentboundary layer on a cone with foreign gas injection .  measurements of average skin friction of the turbulentboundary layer have been made on a 15 total included angle cone withforeign gas injection .  measurements of total skin-friction dragwere obtained at free-stream mach numbers of 0.3, 0.7, 3.5, andx 10 with injection of helium, air, and freon-12through the porous wall .  substantial reductions in skinfriction are realized with gas injection within the range of machnumbers of this test .  the relative reduction in skin friction isin accordance with theory--that is, the light gases are mosteffective when compared on a mass flow basis .  there is a markedeffect of mach number on the reduction of average skin friction,.this effect is not shown by the available theories .  limitedtransition location measurements indicate that the boundary layerdoes not fully trip with gas injection but that the transition pointapproaches a forward limit with increasing injection .  thevariation of the skin-friction coefficient, for the lower injection rateswith natural transition, is dependent on the flow reynoldsnumber and type of injected gas,. and at the high injection rates theskin friction is in fair agreement with the turbulentboundary-layer results .
