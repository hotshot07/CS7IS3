some experimental studies of panel flutter at mach1 .3.  experimental studies of panel flutter were conducted at a machnumber of 1.3 to verify the existence of this phenomenon and to study theeffects of some structural parameters on the flutter characteristics .thin rectangular metal plates were used in these studies and weremounted as a section of the tunnel wall .  most of the data were obtained byusing aluminum-alloy panels, although a few steel, magnesium, and brasspanels were also used .  different materials with various thicknessesand lengths were used to determine the effect of these parameters onpanel flutter .  the experimental program consisted of three phases ..panels clamped front and rear, and (3) buckled panels clamped on allfour edges .  panel flutter was obtained under controlled laboratory conditionsand it was found that, at the flow conditions of these tests, increasingtensile forces were effective in eliminating flutter, as wereshortening the panels or increasing the bending stiffness .  no apparentsystematic trends in the flutter modes or frequencies could be observed,and it is significant that the panel flutter sometimes involved highermodes and frequencies .  the presence of a pressure differential betweenthe two surfaces of a panel was observed to have a stabilizing effect .initially buckled panels were more susceptible to flutter than panelswithout buckling .  buckled panels with all four edges clamped were muchless prone to flutter than buckled panels clamped front and rear .
