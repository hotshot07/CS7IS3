first-order slip effects on the laminar boundary layer over a slenderbody of revolution with zero pressure gradient .in reference 1, the analysis given by probstein and elliott for thezero-pressure-gradient, constant-wall-temperature, compressible,laminar boundary layer with transverse curvature was extended tofirst-order slip flow .  this extension was based on a double asymptoticexpansion in a transverse-curvature parameter and a slip parameter .the expansion in ref. 1, however, was carried out with the parameterheld constant .  for and a constant wall temperature, is constant ande varies with x due to the dependence of the local body radius on x .thus, for arbitrary body shapes, e will not be constant .  in thepresent note, the analysis of ref. 1 is re-examined taking into accountthe variation of e .
