some aspects of non-stationary airfoil theory and itspractical application .  this paper consists of three notes on the theory of two-dimensional thin airfoils in non-uniform motion ..oscillating airfoil are collected from an earlier paper and arepresented in convenient forms for practical application .rigid airfoil passing through a vertical-gust pattern having asinusoidal distribution of intensity .  the lift is determined as afunction of the reduced frequency (which in this case isproportional to the ratio of the airfoil chord and the wave length of thegust pattern) and is presented in the form of a vector diagram .it is shown that the lift acts at the quarter-chord point of theairfoil at all times .calculation of the amplitude of torsional oscillation of a fan bladeoperating in the wake of a set of pre-rotation vanes .  in anumerical example the amplitude is found to be small even whenthe vanes are spaced so that the exciting frequency coincideswith the natural frequency of the fan blade .
