Text: a compressor routine test code .the routine testing of aircraft-type compressors.dash in the main,axial-flow, multi-stage compressors.dash requires a compromise betweenresearch accuracy and the practical considerations .  this test codeis the outcome of a survey of compressor testing techniques andinstrumentation, initiated and subsequently discussed and endorsedby the aerodynamics sub-committee of the gas turbine collaborationcommittee .the code aims at defining methods of measurement and weighting wherebycompressor performance can be obtained sufficiently accuratelyfor a realistic and direct comparison to be made between one compressorand another .  the measurement of a quantity at a point in the fluidflow, and the averaging and weighting of such measurements have beentreated separately as far as is possible .the recommendations are given in the main text, whilst additionaldiscussion on these is put into the appendices .
