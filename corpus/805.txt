Text: ground measurements of the shock wave noise from airplanesin level flight at mach numbers to 1. 4 and at altitudesto 45,000 feet .  time histories of noise pressures near ground level were measuredduring flight tests of fighter-type airplanes over fairly flat, partlywooded terrain in the mach number range between 1.13 and 1.4 and ataltitudes from 25,000 to 45,000 feet .  atmospheric soundings andradar-tracking studies were made for correlation with the measured noisedata .  the measured and calculated values of the pressure rise across theshock wave were generally in good agreement .  there is a tendency forthe theory to overestimate the pressure at locations remote from thetrack and to underestimate the pressures for conditions of high tailwindat altitude .  the measured values of ground-reflection factor averagedabout 1.8 for the surfaces tested as compared to a theoretical valueof 2.0 .  two booms were measured in all cases .  the observers alsogenerally reported two booms,. although, in some cases, only one boomwas reported .  the shock-wave noise associated with some of the flighttests was judged to be objectionable by ground observers, and in onecase the cracking of a plate-glass store window was correlated in timewith the passage of the airplane at an altitude of 25,000 feet .
