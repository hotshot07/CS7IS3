on convective motion of a conducting fluid betweenparallel vertical plates in a magnetic field .  stationary convective motion of a conducting fluidbetween vertical parallel plates in amagnetic field is considered .  an exact solution of themagnetohydrodynamic equations isobtained for the case of a constant vertical temperaturegradient .  the critical value ofgrasshof's number is determined for the case when thetemperature of both plates is the same .
