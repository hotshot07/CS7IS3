a simple extension of southwell's method for determining the elasticgeneral instability pressure of ring-stiffened cylinders subjectto external hydrostatic pressure .a simple extension of southwell's method is presented whereby theelastic general instability pressure of ring-stiffened cylindricalshells subject to external hydrostatic pressure may be determined .  anactual application of the method is illustrated in the paper and theresults of several other examples are summarized .
