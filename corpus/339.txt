experimental evaluation of heat transfer with transpirationcooling in a turbulent boundary layer at m=3 .2.  it is found that for prescribed velocity field, electrical field andconductivity, the current can be calculated by integration .  work isrelated to analytic investigation of the boundary layer in aphysically reasonable accelerator .
