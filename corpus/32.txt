Text: the dynamic motion of a missile descending throughthe atmosphere .  a method is presented for computing rapidly, yet accurately,the dynamic motion of a ballistic-type missile descending throughthe atmosphere .  the equations of motion are separated into aset of /static/ trajectory equations (zero angle of attack) and aset of /rotational/ equations describing the oscillatory motionof the missile about its center of gravity .  a transformationallows the rotational equations to be written in a manneranalogous to the equation for an undamped oscillating spring masssystem with the mass equal to unity and a time variable springconstant .  for given initial conditions this equation can besolved to obtain the envelope of maximum angle of attack .  anadditional transformation allows the calculation of the completeoscillatory motion at any time during the trajectory as a functionof the maximum angle of attack at that time .  this solution shows that the maximum angle of attack of amissile descending through the atmosphere at relatively constantspeed is reduced even when the aerodynamic damping is neglected .
