Text: fundamentals of boundary layer heat transfer with streamwisetemperature variations .  boundary-layer heat transfer is analyzed for the case of asinusoidal distribution of temperature in the direction of flow .  it isshown that for both laminar and turbulent flow the spatialdistribution of heat transfer is generally out of phase with the walltemperature by an angle of 30 to 45 .  this leads to theconclusion that in some areas the heat flow is opposite to thetemperature difference as used in the definition of the heat-transfercoefficient, and points to the basic shortcomings of this concept .the physical explanation for this behavior is found to be thetemperature-field distortion by the fluid motion .  the distortionis measured by the peclet number .  approximate equationsrepresenting a /conduction analogy/ were used in this analysisand the validity of these equations for unsteady flow is examinedwith reference to limitations in frequency and wavelength .  asolution of these equations is given for the case of a velocityprofile which is not a straight line .  the use of previously developedvariational principles for the evaluation of convective heattransfer including cases of three-dimensional unsteady flow,turbulence, and nonparallel streamlines is also discussed .
