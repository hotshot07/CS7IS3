Text: shroud design for simulating hypersonic flow over the nose of ahemisphere .following is an analytical method for designing a shroud which willgenerate the hypersonic pressure distribution on a hemisphere .  themethod was found to be successful throughout the region of subsonicflow .  this shroud was designed as part of a low-turbulence wind tunnelused for investigating the effects of cooling on boundary-layertransition on a hemisphere .the design of the shroud contour was carried out in two steps .  first,an approximate solution for the incompressible, irrotational flowfield was found in the region, and, second, the resulting contourwas corrected for compressibility near the sonic region, assumingone-dimensional flow .
