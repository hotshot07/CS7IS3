Text: unsteady laminar compressible boundary layers on aninfinite plate with suction or injection .  this study deals with unsteady compressible laminarboundary layers on an infinitely extended porous plate .  an integralsolution based on two types of assumed velocity andtemperature profiles is presented for the general case where the unsteadyfree-stream velocity and rate of surface suction or injection areboth arbitrary .  also indicated is an exact solution, applicable,however, only to certain specific unsteady free-stream andsurface suction or injection variations .  the reliability and rangeof validity of the integral solutions is then established on thebasis of numerical results from the exact solution .  finally,several general qualitative conclusions of the unsteady effectsof free-stream velocity and surface suction or injection on laminarboundary-layer behavior are made .
