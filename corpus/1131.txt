the effect of axial constraint on the instability ofthin conical shells under external pressure .  author considers elastic axial restraint which may be (1)active from the beginning of loading and (2) active only at the onsetof buckling .  buckling loads for the two cases are related by asimple conversion factor .  effect of the restraint on theaxisymmetric type buckling is negligible, but the amplification of thecritical load for the nonaxisymmetric type buckling may be verylarge for type (1) restraint .  design curves are included for arange of l d.and restraint stiffness .  results are of doubtfulvalue considering the known inadequacy of the linear theory ofbuckling under axial compression .
