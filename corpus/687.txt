Text: oscillating airfoils at high mach number .a simple formula is given for the pressure distribution on anoscillating airfoil in two-dimensional flow at high mach number . theformula is expected to be reasonably accurate if the pressure on thesurface remains within the range 0.2 to 3.5 times the mainstreampressure . to illustrate the application of the formula, some resultsfor symmetrical airfoils performing pitching oscillations are obtainedand compared with results obtained from existing theories in the case of high mach number .
