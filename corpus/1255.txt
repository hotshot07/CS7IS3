Text: the flow about a charged body moving in the lower atmosphere .  the flow about an electrically charged body traveling at highspeeds through the lower ionosphere is analyzed .  a simplegas model composed of electrons, ions, and neutral particles isused and the hydrodynamic description given is based onmaxwell's transfer equations for a mixture .  the conditions under which local statistical equilibrium canbe assumed are discussed, and different approaches to determinethe gasdynamic force in the subsonic, supersonic, and hypersoniccases are indicated .  the reciprocal action of the electric fieldof the flow on the body is also analyzed and a formula for theresultant electric force is given .  the total force on the bodyis equal to the sum of the gasdynamic force and the electric force .  the negative potential acquired by a plane body is alsocalculated .  finally, the lack of validity of debye's linearizationin this case and the solution of the exterior nonlinear problemwhich characterize the electric potential and the electrondistribution are discussed .
