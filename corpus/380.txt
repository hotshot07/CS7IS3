Text: effect of quasi-steady air forces on incompressiblebending-torsion flutter .  explicit solutions are obtained for the bending-torsion flutterof a two-dimensional airfoil in incompressible flow under theassumptions that the theodorsen function, c(k) is set equal to areal constant, and the diagonal virtual mass terms are negligible .for the case of small bending to torsion frequency ratio, acomparison is made of these quasi-steady solutions with anearlier empirical expression suggested by theodorsen and garrickfor the nonsteady case, and the effect of the c(k) function isindicated .  the importance of the c.g. location for these smallcases is re-emphasized, and the possibility of flutter at zeroair speed is indicated .
