Text: long slender delta wings with leading edge separation .  the slender-body approximation of linearized compressible flow isapplied to the problem of a delta wing in which flow separation occursat the leading edges .  the vortex sheets found in the real flow areapproximated by concentrated vortices with feeding lattices, and aplausible adaptation of kelvin's theorem is applied to simulate theforce-free nature of the vortex sheet .  the computations show that leading-edge separation produces anincrease in lift over that given by the jones slender-wing theory andthat the lift does not vary linearly with angle of attack .  computedpressure distributions and span loadings are presented and thetheoretical lift results are compared with the results of simple force testsmade at a mach number of 1.9 .
