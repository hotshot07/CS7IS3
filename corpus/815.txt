investigation of several blunt bodies to determinetrans- onic aerodynamic characteristics including effectsof spinning and of extendible afterbody flaps and somemeasurements of unsteady base pressures .  several blunt bodies having shapes that may be suitable foratmospheric reentry vehicles were tested to determine the aerodynamiccharacteristics of such shapes for angles of attack up to 34 .  the testswere conducted through the transonic mach number range and at reynoldsnumbers from 1.74 x 10 to 2.78 x 10, based on body diameter .  a full-skirted rather than a short-skirted type of shape developedthe greatest amount of static stability and the largest lift-curveslopes .  the angle of attack for maximum lift for such bodies appearsto be subject to mach number effects .  spinning a full-skirted bodyabout its longitudinal axis generally increased the lift and reduced thepitching moment at angles of attack and reduced the aerodynamic staticstability parameter through the transonic mach number range .  theextension of segmented clamshell-shaped flaps from the afterbody of ashort-skirted model served to increase the lift and static stabilityonly if the flaps extended into the airstream .  some evidence was found of oscillatory base pressures on twodissimilar shapes at certain high angles of attack and the highest machnumber in these tests .  there is doubt, however, that these pressurescan induce any significant oscillatory motion for a reentry vehiclebecause of their small amplitude and phasing .
