Text: a theoretical study of annular supersonic nozzles .  this paper is concerned with the designof annular supersonic nozzles to produce uniformflow in supersonic wind tunnels which are axi-symmetricaland which have an internal coaxial circular cylinderthroughout .  symmetrical two-dimensional and conventionalaxi-symmetrical nozzles are special cases ofannular nozzles .  proposals are made for design criteria sufficient toensure that the flow inside a nozzle is free from limitlines and shock waves,. the criteria for (symmetrical)two-dimensional and (conventional) axi-symmetricalnozzles are new .  the two outstanding procedures fordesigning two-dimensional and axi-symmetrical nozzlesare generalised to apply to annular nozzles .  one of thedesign procedures is mainly analytical and the other ismainly numerical,. the analytical expressions in bothprocedures are made much more complicated by thepresence of the internal cylinder but the numerical processcriteria and the mainly numerical design procedure aresuccessfully applied to the design of a particularannular nozzle .
