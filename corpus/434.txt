Text: contributions of the wing panels to the forces andmoments of supersonic wing-body combinations at combinedangles .  a wind-tunnel investigation wasconducted at a mach number of 1.96and at reynolds numbers (based on themean aerodynamic chord of theexposed wing) of 0.36 and 1.03 millionto determine the normal forces,pitching moments, and rolling momentscontributed by each wing panel ofa cruciform-wing and body combinationover a wide range of combinedangles of pitch and roll .  the wingswere triangular of aspect ratio 2,and the body was an ogive-cylindercombination .  the effects of forebodylength and roughness and of thepresence of the adjacent panels on thesepanel contributions were determined .  the results of the investigationshow that large changes in the panelforces and moments can occur as theresult of combined angles .  a generaltheoretical method based on slender-bodyand strip theories was found toyield results in good agreement with thewind-tunnel measurements .  thesecomparisons indicate that the changes inthe panel characteristics due tocombined angles are caused primarily bya cross coupling between theside-wash velocities due to angle of attackand sideslip and by the presenceof forebody vortices due to crossflowseparation .  it was found that anincrease in forebody length increasesthe effect of the forebody vorticesbecause of the dependence of the strengthof these vortices on the forebodylength .
