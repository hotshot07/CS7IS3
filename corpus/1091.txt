Text: data from a static thrust investigation of a largescale general research vtol-stol model in ground effect .  the model was tested at two different elevations with the wingpivot at 1.008 and 2.425 propeller diameters above the ground .  theslipstream of the propellers was deflected by tilting the wing andpropellers, by deflections of large-chord trailing-edge flaps, and bycombinations of flap deflection and wing tilt .  tests were conducted overa range of propeller disk loadings from 7.41 to 29.70 pounds per squarefoot .  force data for the complete model and pressure distributions forthe wing and flaps behind one propeller were recorded and are presentedin tabular form without analysis .
