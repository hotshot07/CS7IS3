Text: the buckling shear stress of simply-supported infinitelylong plates with transverse stiffeners .  this report is an extension of previous theoreticalinvestigations of the elastic buckling in shear of flatplates reinforced by transverse stiffeners . the plates are treatedas infinitely long and simply-supported along the longsides . stiffeners are spaced at regular intervals, dividing the plateinto a number of panels of uniform size . the effectob bending and torsional stiffnesses of the stiffener upon the bucklingshear stress is calculated for the complete rangeof stiffnesses, for panels with ratios of width to stiffener spacing ofgraphical forms .
