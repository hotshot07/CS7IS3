acoustical signal detection in turbulent airflow .  improvement in detected signal-to-noise ratio is obtainedfor a periodic signal masked by additive noiseand turbulent noise backgrounds .  comparisons are madebetween autocorrelation, crosscorrelation, and acombination of frequency filtering and crosscorrelation .although the latter method provided the greatestimprovement, the crosscorrelation technique was themost successful single method .  it turned out thatthe maximum improvement obtainable was limited bythe dynamic range of the correlator computer andnot by errors due to finite averaging time and scanningthe delay .  the improvement for signals masked byturbulent noise was found to be about 5 db less than thatobtained for additive noise .
