Text: rayleigh's problem for a cylinder of arbitrary shape .the motion of an incompressible viscous fluid generated by a cylinder of arbitrary cross-sectional form which is started to move suddenly fromrest with uniform velocity in the direction of its length is considered formulae in powers of are derived for the velocity distribution /validin the vicinity of the cylinder/ and for the frictional drag on thecylinder, correct to the order of a, where a is the characteristic lengthof the cross section, v is the kinematic viscosity, and t is the time .these formulae are given in terms of only the analytic function whichmaps conformally the region outside the cross section of the cylinderonto the region outside the unit circle, and of certain integrals ewhich are common to any arbitrary cylinder . in particular, when a issufficiently small, the total frictional drag on the cylinder per unitlength is expressed as, irrespective of the cross-sectional form, whereb 2 and y 0.5772.../euler's constant/ .
