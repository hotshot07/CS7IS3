a study of supersonic combustion .  steady, stable, plain, and oblique detonation waves werecreated in a high-temperature, steady flow supersonic tunnel .ignition conditions and properties across the wave weremeasured .  the local-wave fluid-dynamic properties agree wellwith detonation theory .  experimental data are presented indetail and compared with other studies and theory .experimental behavior of these detonations and their possible utilityare discussed .
