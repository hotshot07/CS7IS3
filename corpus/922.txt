Text: supersonic flow past slender bodies of revolution,slope of whose median section is discontinuous .  the theory of supersonic flow aroundslender bodies of revolution, yawed orunyawed, with pointed or open bows, basedon the linearized equation, is extendedto the case when the meridian section ofthe outer surface has discontinuities inslope .  expressions for the pressure distributionon the surface are obtained .  it isfound that the drag coefficient is no longerindependent of mach number, and tendsto zero more slowly than the square of thethickness of the body .  the large pressurechange behind a discontinuity is made upremarkably rapidly .  the firstapproximation to the lift coefficient is unchanged .
