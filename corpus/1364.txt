an experimental investigation of the interaction between shock waves and boundary layers .an account is given of an investigation into the interaction between the boundary layer on a flat plate and a shock wave produced eitherexternally, by a wedge in the supersonic mainstream, or from within theboundary layer, by a wedge held in contact with the plate . a wide range of free-stream mach numbers, boundary-layer reynolds numbers, and shock strengths has been covered, shock strength being defined as the ratioof the static pressure downstream of the shock to the static pressureupstream of it . variations in these parameters can have large effectson the interaction, and there are also large differences between caseswith externally generated shocks and cases where the shock is generatedfrom within the boundary layer . the investigation has thrown light onthe physical mechanisms involved . it is found that many of the majorfeatures of the interaction arise because the boundary layer separatesfrom the surface ahead of the shock wave . the conditions under whichseparation occurs and the behaviour of the separated boundary layer thus have important effects, in terms of which, for example, the differences between the interactions observed with laminar and with turbulentboundary layers may be explained .
