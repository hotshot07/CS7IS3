Text: on the influence of wall boundary layers in closed transonic testsections .the boundary layers at the test section walls of a transonic wind tunnel are known to reduce the wall interference . in the present paper thiseffect is studied by means of small perturbation theory, assumingviscosity to be negligible when perturbing a turbulent boundary layer . anapproximation for thin boundary layers leads to a modified boundarycondition at the wall of the test section, expressing the normalstreamline slope induced by changes in mass flow density and crossflowwithin the boundary layer . this boundary condition is applied to thelinearized equations of subsonic flow and to the non-linear transonicequations at choking, the cases of plane and circular test sections only being treated in detail .the results of linear theory show that all corrections except thethree-dimensional angle-of-attack correction are considerably reduced by the presence of the boundary layers at mach numbers greater than 0.9,the essential part of their influence being due to the change of massflow density with pressure . in the case of choking the analysisindicates that the presence of boundary layers will increase the maximummodel size for which the flow can be interpreted as corresponding tomach number one in free flight . finally, the technique of usingartificial thickening of the wall boundary layers for a reduction of wallinterference is considered, though without reaching a definiteconclusion as to its value as compared to other techniques .
