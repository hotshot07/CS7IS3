Text: static longitudinal stability characteristics of a blunted gliderre-entry configuration having 79.5degree sweepback and 45degree dihedral at a mach number of 6.2 and angles of attack up to 20degree .an experimental investigation was conducted at a mach number of 6.2 todetermine the static longitudinal stability characteristics of a modelof a blunted glider reentry configuration having 79.5degree sweepbackand 45degree dihedral . the free-stream reynolds number for theinvestigation was 3.0 x 10 based on the basic model length of 7.5 inches .tests were made through an angle-of-attack range from 0degrees toinvestigation showed that incorporating 10degree nose incidence in thebasic model resulted in a lower lift-curve slope, a lower lift-dragratio, a higher value of trim lift coefficient, and a decrease in static longitudinal stability . in comparison, the effect of extending theconfiguration length and incorporating 10degrees and 20degrees boattailangles resulted in smaller changes in the longitudinal stabilitycharacteristics of the model .
