the buckling of a square panel under shear, when onepair of opposite edges is clamped and the other pairis simply supported .  reasons for investigation.--for an efficient designof spar with thin sheet web it is important to knowthe load which will just cause the web to buckle .  as stiffenersdivide the web into panels, it is required to find thebuckling stress of rectangular panels bounded on two sides byspar flanges and on the other two sides by stiffeners .boundary conditions which represent closely this type of edgefixing are clamping (along the flanges) and simple supportcritical shear stress for a square panel held in this way .  conclusions and further development.--it is found that thevalue of the critical shear stress is almost midway betweenits values when all four edges are clamped and all four edgesare simply supported .  the method of solution developed in this report is of verygeneral application, and can be used to investigate thestability of rectangular panels when the loading is any combinationof shear and compression or tension, and the edgesare clamped or simply supported, and not necessarily all clampedor all simply supported .  by an easy extension themethod of solution can also be used to find the periods of transversevibration of rectangular panels for the same typesof loading and edge fixing .
