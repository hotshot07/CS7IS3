cavitation and pressure distributionhead forms at zero angle of yaw .early in the fall of 1943 the iowa institute of hydraulic researchundertook the design and fabrication of a variable-pressure watertunnel .  as the tunnel neared completion, however, its immediate usefor the study of the pressure distribution around various body formswas requested .the original request for this investigation was a natural out-growthof the need for systematic data on the distribution of pressurein flow around various bodies, particularly under conditions leading tocavitation, information which is desirable for the design of a widevariety of navy equipment .  ultimately the study is to include datafor two- and three-dimensional head and tail forms at various angles ofyaw .  the first phase of the study, namely the investigation ofthree-dimensional head forms at zero angle of yaw, is described herein .three general geometric series have been studied.dash rounded,ellipsoidal, and conical.dash together with other related forms .the data obtained have been systematized to yield information fora wide variety of geometrical forms either directly or byinterpolation .  whenever possible, analytical methods have been used tocorroborate the experimental data and to provide a reliable meansof generalizing the results .
