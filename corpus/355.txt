Text: the injection of air into the dissociated hypersonic laminar boundarylayer .in first approximation, dissociated air may be treated as a binarymixture of air atoms and air molecules .  in order to include theeffects of mass transfer into the boundary layer, it becomes necessaryto introduce a third chemical species and hence a second diffusionequation .  we have avoided this complexity by considering the injectionof air molecules into the boundary layer, and hence the theoreticaltreatment is accomplished within the framework of a binary mixture gas .
