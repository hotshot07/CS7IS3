Text: the skin friction on infinite cylinders moving parallell to their length .the frictional force on a cylinder moving steadily parallel to itslength through a viscous liquid which is initially at rest is determined with reasonable accuracy over the whole range of values of the duration of the motion and for a wide variety of shapes of the cylindercross-section . when the time t is small, the first approximation gives aforce per unit area which is the same as that for a flat plate ofinfinite width . the second approximation takes the shape of the cylinderinto account and the force on unit length of cylinder is determined interms of the number of corners, and their angles, in the cylinder crosslinder is the same, to this approximation, as that on a circularcylinder of the same perimeter . for large values of t the determination ofthe frictional force is reducible to that of a potential problem, thesolution of which is known for a number of different shapes . theapproximations for small and large values of t for any one cylinder donot overlap but can be joined without much ambiguity . for no value of t do the forces on cylinders of different shape /excluding those whosecurvature is not everywhere inwards/ differ by more than about 25 percent .
