on an equation occurring in falkner and skan's approximatetreatment of the equation of the boundary layer .  the differential analyserhas been used to evaluate solutions of the equation y''' = -yy'' +with boundary conditions y = y' = 0 at x = 0, aswhich occurs in falkner and skan's approximate treatment of thelaminar boundary layer (see abstract 1081 (1932)) .  a numericaliterative method has been used to improve the accuracy of the solutions,and the results show that the accuracy of the machine solutions is aboutinsufficient to specify a unique solution for negative values of,.a discussion of this situation is given, and it is shown that for theapplication to be made of the solution the appropriate condition is thatfrom below, and as rapidly as possible, as .  the condition thatfrom below can be satisfied only for values of greater than a limitingvalue whose value is approximately -0.199, and which is related to thepoint at which the laminar boundary layer breaks away from theboundary .
