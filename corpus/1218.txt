Text: experimental lift and drag of a series of glide configurationsat mach numbers 12 .6 and 17 .5.  a series of semiballistic-type bodies consisting of three halfsphere cones of 0.3 bluntness ratio with half-cone angles of 8.6,laboratory hypersonic shock tunnel at m = 17.5 and 12.4 .in addition, a representative winged glide configurationconsisting of a sharp-edged, 60 swept delta wing with cone-segmentthe range of angle of attack for the half sphere-cone tests was  the technique for force coefficient determination consists ofanalyzing high-speed motion pictures of the motion of very lightbalsa and isofoam plastic models which are literally free-flownfor several milliseconds in the test section of the shock tunnel .  because of viscous effects the newtonian prediction of halfsphere cone drag is consistently less than, but generally parallelthese bodies is generally well predicted by the newtonian theoryexcept at small and moderate positive angles of attack where it isgenerally less than newtonian .  this lift deficiency appears toincrease with cone half angle .  maximum lift-drag ratios fallconsiderably short of the newtonian predictions .  severalexploratory tests at mach 11.7 and low reynolds number (approximately reduction in) on the 13 model produced anapproximate doubling of minimum drag and a 35 percentdecrease in (l d) max,. this demonstrates the importance of viscouseffects for blunt bodies in the reynolds number range of thesetests .  the sharp leading-edge, 60 sweep delta wing-bodyconfiguration exhibited the same (l d) max, as the wing alone, about 2.80at both positive and negative angles of attack .
