plastic stability theory of geometrically orthotropicplates and cylindrical shells .  a linear eighth-order equilibrium differential equation forplastic buckling of geometrically orthotropic thin cylindricalshells is derived .  this equation is used to obtain explicitsolutions for long flat plates and wide columns under axialcompression and moderate-length cylinders under external pressure,torsion, and axial compression .
