Text: analytic study of induced pressure on long bodies ofrevolution with varying nose bluntness at hypersonicspeeds .  a systematic study of induced pressures on a seriesof bodies of revolution with varying nose bluntnesshas been made by using the method of characteristicsfor a perfect gas .  the fluid mediums investigatedwere air and helium and the mach number rangewas from 5 to 40 .  a study of representative shockshapes was also made .  flow parameters obtainedfrom the blast-wave analogy gave good correlations ofinduced pressures and shock shapes .  theinduced-pressure correlations yielded empirical equations forair and helium which cover the complete range ofnose bluntness considered .  (nose fineness ratiosvaried from 0.4 to 4.)  available experimentalresults were in good agreement with the characteristicssolutions .  properties connected with the concept ofhypersonic similitude enabled correlations of thecalculations to be made with respect to nose shape,mach number, and ratio of specific heats .
