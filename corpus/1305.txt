Text: a proposed programme of wind tunnel tests at hypersonicspeeds to investigate the lifting properties of geometricallyslender shapes .  a programme of tests at hypersonicspeeds on slender bodies isdescribed, which has the aim ofinvestigating how lift is generated, andthe compromises that may be enforcedby aerodynamic heating .  the programmeis based on models of simple geometricshape, from which liftingconfigurations will later be built up .
