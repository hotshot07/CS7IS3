Text: discussion of solar proton events and manned spaceflights .  as a result of studies made during theinternational geophysical year (igy) and theinternational geophysical cooperation (igc),it is known that a considerable fraction oflarge solar flares give rise to almost purestreams of protons which reach the earth andcontinue to arrive for as long as 11 days .the energies of these particles lie within avery steep spectrum extending from 20 toleast 500 mev .  because of the frequencyof large flares during times of high solaractivity, and owing to the long duration of eachsolar proton emission, these particles werepresent in detectable intensity near the topof the earth's atmosphere for about 15 percentof the time from 1957 to 1960 .  the numberof large flares that accelerated and releasedthese particles during this three-year period was about 30 .  the event that began on august 22, 1958contributed greatly toward the understandingof the solar and terrestrial sequence of events,and in addition provided the firstidentification of the emitted particles .  a flare on mayof protons in the neighborhood of the earth thatthis phenomenon was recognized as anadditional radiation hazard to manned vehiclesin the high atmosphere and in most partsof the solar system .  the three very intenseevents that occurred in july, 1959 furthersupported this conclusion, and the possibilityof predicting such events became animportant consideration .  in addition to its valuein the protection of human beings, effectiveforecasting clearly would be of great value inthe detailed scientific study of thisphenomenon .  this paper presents a preliminarydiscussion of some aspects of predicting thearrival of protons at the earth following theappearance of solar activity features and,equally important, of forecasting the periodswhen this penetrating radiation is unlikelyto occur .
