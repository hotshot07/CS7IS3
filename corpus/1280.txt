wings with minimum drag due to lift in supersonic flow .  it has been shown by r. t. jones that, in order to produceminimum drag, the given lift must be distributed over the wingsurface in such a way that the sum of the downwash induced bythis distribution and the downwash induced in reversed flow isconstant over the wing surface .  this combined downwash can beexpressed by an integral which contains the load as a functionof the spanwise and chordwise coordinate .  the problem offinding the appropriate load distribution is thus reduced to theproblem of finding the solution of a rather cumbersome integralequation .  the severe spanwise singularity of the kernel function ishandled most easily, as in corresponding subsonic problems, by anapproximate integration over interpolation polynomials .  thechordwise load distribution is represented by a limited seriesdevelopment in legendre polynomials .  the sigularity of thekernel function along the mach lines through any pivotal pointcan be avoided by a similar legendre development of thecombined induced downwash which is constant .  the integralequation is thus converted into a system of linear equations for theunknown coefficients of the legendre functions of the loaddistribution at a limited number of spanwise stations .  practical calculations are carried out on an electroniccomputer .  the solutions yield the optimum load distribution and thelocal incidence (twist, camber, etc.) necessary to realize thisdistribution .  for many wing plan forms, considerable gainsover a plane wing appear possible .
