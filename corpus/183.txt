properties of impact pressure probes in free moleculeflow .  an expression has been derived for the mass flow througha circular tube in free molecule flow when the tube and gas are inrelative motion .  the gas entering the tube is assumed to have amaxwellian distribution function and the molecular reflection processat the wall is assumed to be diffuse .  the theory has been used to determine the pressure readby an impact probe in free molecule flow .  although the generalexpressions derived apply to any value of gas velocity and tube size,the detailed calculations for the pressure probe are difficult exceptfor the case of low speeds and long tubes .  an experimental check of the theory has been carried outusing impact probes in a whirling arm apparatus and in the utia lowdensity wind tunnel .  agreement between theory and experiment isquite satisfactory .
