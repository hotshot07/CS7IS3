Text: handbook of structural stability . pt .vi . strengthof stiffened curved plates and shells .  a comprehensive review of failureof stiffened curved plates andshells is presented .  panel instability in stiffenedcurved plates and general instabilityof stiffened cylinders are discussed .the loadings considered for theplates are axial, shear, and thecombination of the two .  for thecylinders, bending, external pressure,torsion, transverse shear, andcombinations of these loads are considered .  general instability in stiffenedcylinders was investigated .  forbending and torsion loads, test dataand theory were correlated .  forexternal pressure several existingtheories were compared .  as a resultof this investigation a unified theoreticalapproach to analysis ofgeneral instability in stiffened cylinderswas developed .
