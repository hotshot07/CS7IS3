static aerodynamic characteristics of a short blunt10 semi-vertex angle cone at a mach number of 15 inhelium .  axial force, normal force, pitchingmoment, and shock-wave shape weredetermined for a body of revolutionconsisting of a short blunt 10 semivertexangle cone with a flat base and also witha conical afterbody having asemi-vertex angle of 50 .  measurements weremade in helium at a free-stream machnumber of 15 and a free-stream reynoldsnumber of 2.25x10 based on maximum bodydiameter over an angle-of-attack range from  the configuration with the conicalafterbody was statically stable in thenose-forward attitude only, whereas theconfiguration with no afterbody wasstatically stable in both the nose-forwardand base-forward attitudes .  the forceand moment data of both shapes were predictedreasonably well by modifiednewtonian theory at all angles of attack,except the pitching-moment coefficientfor the model without afterbody near 180angle of attack .  in this region,measurements indicated static stability, whereastheory indicated static instability .the helium data agreed reasonably well witha limited amount of force and momentdata obtained in a ballistic range at smallangles of attack in air at a machnumber of 15 and also with force and momentdata obtained in air over a completeangle-of-attack range at a mach number of 5.5 .the value of axial-forcecoefficient and the shape of the bow shock wave atzero angle of attack for both modelsobtained from a numerical flow field calculationagreed very well with the data .the value of the axial force coefficient at 180angle of attack for the modelwith afterbody agreed reasonably well with thetheoretical value for a cone .  theposition and shape of the shock envelope nearthe stagnation point also could bepredicted accurately by an approximate methodover an angle-of-attack range from
