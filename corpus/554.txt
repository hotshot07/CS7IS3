Text: generalized heat transfer formulas and graphs .  utilizing the research results of previouslyreported investigations of the laminar, turbulent andradiative heat transfer in dissociated air, somegeneralized formulas for calculating heat transferare given .  graphs for determining the laminarheat transfer, momentum thickness reynoldsnumber, and turbulent heat transfer distributionsaround an axisymmetric body are also given .these heat transfer correlations are valid for velocitiesbetween 6000 and 26,000 fps and for altitudesup to 250,000 ft .  this range of velocities andaltitudes covers the important re-entry regime ofpractical re-entry trajectories having interest today .in the last section of this report thesegeneralized results are specialized for icbm nose cone re-entryapplications .  these formulas and graphsmay be found useful for making rapid engineeringestimates and preliminary design evaluationsof the heating problems associated with re-entryinto earth's atmosphere .
