recent advances in the buckling of thin shells .the importance of the field of shell analysis is evidenced by thefact that in august, 1959, the international union of theoreticaland applied mechanics conducted a symposium on the theory of thinelastic shells in delft, holland .  this special meeting was attened byapproximately 65 scientists in this field from 14 countries .  thissymposium indicated that considerable interest currently exists insuch relatively new topics as the buckling of bimetallic shells,pressurized shells, creep buckling, and dynamic buckling, as well asin the more traditional problems involving isotropic shells of variousgeometries .
