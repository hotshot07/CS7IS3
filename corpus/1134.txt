torispherical shells - a caution to designers .  it has recently become apparent, througha rigorous stress analysis of a specific casethat designing torispherical shells by thecurrent edition of the asme code on unfiredpressure vessels can lead to failure duringproof-testing of the vessel .  the purposeof the present paper is to show in whatrespects the code fails to give accurate results .as an illustrative example, a hypotheticalpressure vessel with a torispherical headhaving a diameter-thickness ratio of 440 wasselected .  the supports of the vessel wereconsidered to be either on the main cylinderor around the torus .  the vessel wassubjected to internal pressure and the elasticstresses in it were determined rigorously andby the code .  a comparison of the tworevealed that the code predicted stresses in thehead which were less than one half of thoseactually occurring .  furthermore, the codegave no indication of the presence of highcompressive circumferential direct stresseswhich exceeded 30,000 psi for practicallythe entire torus .  if the head had beenfabricated using a steel with a yield point ofwould have failed or undergone largedeformations, whereas the code would havepredicted that it was safe .  the code's rulesfor torispherical heads are thus in need ofrevision for certain geometries .  theimplications of the foregoing results are currentlybeing studied by the asme,. in the interim,however, designers should exercise care inapplying the code to torispherical shells .  it is also shown in the paper that the useof the membrane state as a particularsolution of the differential equations is not agood approximation for toroidal shells of thetype considered .
