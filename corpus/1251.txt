viscous flow past a quarter infinite plate .  a study is made of the motion of an incompressible viscousfluid past a quarter-infinite plate, whose leading edge isperpendicular to and whose side edge is parallel to the undisturbeddirection of the stream .  it is assumed that the kinematicviscosity is small .  the first approximation is taken to be theundisturbed motion, and successive approximations are obtainedby iferation .  the second approximation is the blasius shearlayer necessary to satisfy the boundary conditions on the plate .in turn, this layer leads to a velocity component normal to theplate which needs a potential solution, in which the velocitiesare 0, to match with the conditions at infinity .  further,the match at the edge of the blasius shear layer must becompleted to 0 by introducing a secondary shear layer .  theregions near the leading and side edges are considered separately,.in particular, the neighborhood of the side edge needs specialcare, because the determination of the chief terms is complicatedby the presence of powers of log .  in particular it is shownthat the effect of the edge is to change the skin-friction coefficientby a factor
