calculation and compilation of the unsteady lift functions for a rigidwing subjected to sinusoidal gusts and to sinusoidal sinkingoscillations .the total lift responses of wings to sinusoidal gusts and to sinusoidalvertical oscillations are calculated from the response to gustpenetration and to a sudden change in sinking velocity through use of thewell-established reciprocal relations for unsteady flow . the casesconsidered are two-dimensional wings in incompressible, subsoniccompressible, sonic, and supersonic flow,. elliptical and rectangular wings in incompressible flow,. wide rectangular and delta wings in supersonic flow,. and delta wings of vanishingly low aspect ratio inincompressible and compressible flow . for most of the cases considered,closed-form expressions are given and the final results are presented in the form of plots of the square of the modulus of the lift coefficientfor wings in a sinusoidally oscillating gust and in the form of the real and imaginary parts of the lift component for wings undergoingsinusoidal sinking oscillations . a summary table is presented as a guide to the scope and results of this paper,. this table contains the figureand equation numbers for the types of flow and plan forms considered .
