Text: calculated spanwise lift distributions and aerodynamicinfluence coefficients for swept wings in subsonicflow .  spanwise lift distributions have been calculated for 61 swept wingswith various aspect ratios and taper ratios and with a variety ofangle-of-attack or twist distributions, including flap and ailerondeflections, by means of the weissinger method with eight control pointson the semispan .  also calculated for these plan forms were aerodynamicinfluence coefficients which pertain to a certain definite set ofstations along the span .  the information presented herein can thus beused both in the analysis of untwisted wings or wings with known twistdistributions and in aeroelastic calculations involving initiallyunknown twist distributions .  this paper supplements and is intended to be used in conjunctionwith naca tn 3014, where the same type of information, calculated in thesame way, is presented for 19 unswept wings .
