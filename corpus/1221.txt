steady flow of conducting fluids in channels undertransverse magnetic fields, with consideration of halleffect .  an approximate method of solution based on a minimumprinciple is presented for the steady laminar incompressible flow of anelectrically conducting fluid through a straight channel ofarbitrary cross section with conducting or nonconducting walls in thepresence of a uniform transverse magnetic field .  the hall effectis taken into account by making simplifying assumptions that thegas is fully ionized and that both reynolds number and magneticreynolds number are small .  numerical calculations are carriedout for the case of a rectangular channel .
