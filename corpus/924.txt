a method for calculating the lift and centre of pressureof wing-body-tail combinations at subsonic, transonicspeeds .  a method is presented forcalculating the lift and pitching-momentcharacteristics of circular cylindricalbodies in combination withtriangular, rectangular, or trapezoidalwings or tails through the subsonic,transonic, and supersonic speed ranges .the method covers unbankedwings, sweptback leading edges orsweptforward trailing edges, lowangles of attack, and the effects ofwing and tail incidence .  thewing-body interference is handled by themethod presented in naca rm's a51j04and a52b06, and the wing-tail interferenceis treated by assuming onecompletely rolled-up vortex per wingpanel and evaluating the tail loadby strip theory .  a computing tableand set of design charts arepresented which reduce the calculationsto routine operations .  comparisonis made between the estimated andexperimental characteristics for alarge number of wing-body and wing-body-tailcombinations .  generallyspeaking, the lifts were estimated towithin 10 percent and the centersof pressure were estimated to withineffect of wing deflection on wing-tailinterference at supersonic speedswas not correctly predicted for triangularwings with supersonic leadingedges .
