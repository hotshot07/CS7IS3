breathing vibrations of a circular shell with an internalliquid .  resonant breathing frequencies and mode shapes aredetermined experimentally for a thin-walled, circular cylindrical shellcontaining a nonviscous incompressible liquid .  the resonantfrequencies determined for the full shell are in good agreementwith those predicted by reissner's shallow-shell vibration theorywith the inclusion of an apparent-mass term for the liquid .  theeffect of the internal liquid on the shell mode shapes is significantonly for the partially full shell .  in this case the circumferentialnode lines tend to shift toward the bottom or filled portion of theshell .  excitation of low-frequency liquid-sloshing motion byhigh-frequency forced oscillation of a partially filled shell occurred inmany cases .  this low-frequency liquid response is tentativelyexplained as being excited by a beat frequency in the forcedoscillation .  a similar type of response has been reported byyarymovych in axially excited rigid tanks .
