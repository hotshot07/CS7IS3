Text: thermodynamic coupling in boundary layers .  experimental results gathered in recent years for binarymixture mass transfer models are shown to yield consistentevidence of discrepancies with analytic considerations .  specifically,measured recovery temperatures are appreciably higher than thosepredicted ,. while heat transfer coefficients are satisfactorilyreproduced .  it is shown on the basis of both approximate and exactsolutions for plates and stagnation points that the discrepancies inprevious results are related to thermal diffusion effects, a majorinfluence being apparent in application of the surface boundarycondition for an adiabatic wall .  as a result, some reexamination isnecessary of past criteria for mass addition effects as they pertain tospecific injected media .  a prime example is the /equivalence/ ofhelium and air as coolants despite the heretofore suggested preferencefor low density injectants on a perfect gas basis .  ref. 16 .
