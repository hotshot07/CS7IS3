thermal buckling of clamped cylindrical shells .the problem of thermal buckling of shells arises inconnection with air-frame bodies subject to aerodynamic heating atsupersonic speeds .  the case of the shell with clamped edges ispresented, as this case typifies all structures with a tubular shellstiffened at intervals with stiffening rings .  the shell is assumedto be unrestrained longitudinally and fully restrained laterally atthe edges .
