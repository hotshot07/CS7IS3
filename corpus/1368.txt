Text: three dimensional viscous wakes .the velocity fields of three-dimensionalviscous wakes are examined with theuse of the boundary-layer approximations,osoen's linearization of the convectiveterms, and the assumption of constantfluid properties .  transform methodsyield solutions for general types of initialconditions .  as an illustration, theaxial velocity distribution of a wake whoseinitial isovels (lines of constantvelocity) are of elliptic shape and their decayto axial symmetry are demonstrated .both laminar and turbulent flows are considered .
