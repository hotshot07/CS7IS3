Text: theoretical and experimental investigation of thermalstresses in hypersonic aircraft wing structures .  a simple and relatively accurate analytic approximation isdeveloped to determine the temperature and thermal-stressdistribution in aircraft wing structures .  theoretical investigationsshow that the results of the existing thermal-stress theorieswhich neglect the temperature gradient through the skinthickness may exceed, in the range of higher biot numbers, the truevalues by more than 30 percent .  refined photothermoelastic experiments verify these resultsand add another significant conclusion .  they indicate thatthermal stresses in wing structures generated by a variableheat-transfer coefficient coincide with the theoretical predictionswhich are based on a constant heat-transfer coefficient, as longas the latter represents the arithmetic average over the heatingcycle and the variation is in the order of 10 percent .however, even much greater variations in the order of 100 percentproduce only relatively small differences .
