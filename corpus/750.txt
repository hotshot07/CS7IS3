Text: transonic flow in two dimensional and axially symmetricalnozzles .  by means of suitable expansionsin inverse powers of r, theradius of curvature of the nozzle profileat the throat measured in throathalf-heights, the velocity componentsin the throat region of aconvergent-divergent nozzle can becalculated .  the first three terms ofthe series solution have been obtainedboth for two-dimensional and foraxially-symmetric nozzles .  thenumerical accuracy of the solution isconfirmed by comparison with theknown exact solution along the branchline .
