Text: similar solutions in compressible laminar free mixingproblems .there are in supersonic aerodynamics many situations ofpractical interest wherein streams of different velocities and,in general, different stagnation pressures mix with one another .in the majority of these problems the interaction between thetwo streams takes place in the presence of an axial pressuregradient .  its effect on the characteristics of the mixing mayinfluence significantly the performances of the devices whereinthe phenomena cited above occur .  a theoretical andexperimental program of research to study mixing in the presence ofaxial pressure gradients is being carried on at the polytechnicinstitute of brooklyn .
