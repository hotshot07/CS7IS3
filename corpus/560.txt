a theoretical study of the effect of upstreamtranspiration-cooling on the heat transfer and skin friction characteristicsof a compressible laminar boundary layer .  an analysis is presented which predictsthe skin-friction andheat-transfer characteristics of a compressible,laminar boundary layer on asolid flat plate preceded by a poroussection that is transpiration cooled .the analysis is restricted to a prandtlnumber of unity and linearvariation of viscosity with temperature .  the local skin friction has beenfound to have a low value in theregion of transpiration cooling and thento increase until it approachesthe value for a completely nonporous surfaceasymptotically .  the initialincrease in local skin friction is rapidas half of the ultimate increaseoccurs in a distance beyond the porousregion that is about 20 percent ofthe length of the porous region for all ratesof injection .  when thetotal coolant flow rate is kept constantand the porous length is varied,it is found that the average skin frictionon a partially porous plate isslightly lower than that on a fully porous plate .  the local heat transfer behaves ina manner similar to that of thelocal skin friction .  it is found, inan example, that the temperatureat the end of a partially porous platecould be maintained at about thesame temperature as a fully porous plateby doubling the total rate ofcoolant flow .
