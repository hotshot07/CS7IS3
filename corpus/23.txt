skin-friction and heat transfer characteristics ofa laminar boundary layer on a cylinder in axial incompressibleflow .  a solution is given for the case of the laminar boundary layerof an incompressible fluid of constant properties on the exteriorof a cylinder with flow parallel to the cylinder axis .  this casediffers from the blasius solution for flow along a flat plate byconsidering the effect of the curvature in a plane transverse tothe flow direction .  the local skin-friction and heat-transfercoefficients for a prandtl number of 0.715 are evaluated andcompared to the similar magnitudes for flat plate flow, and theeffect of the curvature is shown to be significant in some practicalcases .  recovery factors are evaluated, and this quantity isfound to be insensitive to the effect of curvature of the boundary .
