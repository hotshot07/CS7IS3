Text: real-gas laminar boundary layer skin friction and heattransfer .  the laminar-boundary-layer equations have been integratedfor the case of a flat plate over a wide range of free-streamenthalpies and velocities and over a wide range of enthalpies ofthe gas at the wall .  the range of free-stream velocities extendedup to 25,000 ft sec at low free-stream enthalpies, correspondingto local conditions on a slender body traveling at high speeds .at low free-stream velocities, the range of free-stream enthalpiesextended up to 400,000 btu slug, corresponding to the localconditions on a blunt body traveling at speeds up to 25,000 ft sec .the gas was assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium at eachpoint in the boundary layer and diffusion effects were neglected .the solutions to the boundary-layer equations were carried outon a high-speed digital computing machine, both skin-friction andheat-transfer coefficients being obtained from the computations .  before presenting the results, the t' method of rubesin andjohnson for computing skin-friction coefficients for theperfect-gas case is reviewed .  for the real-gas case, the averagetemperature, t', is replaced by the average enthalpy, h', and the h'method is then used to compute skin-friction coefficients .  thesevalues are in excellent agreement with the computing-machineresults .  it was found that the recovery factor for the real-gascase can be approximated by, the best results for thecases considered being obtained if a value of pr corresponding tothe enthalpy, h', is used .  using this recovery factor andreynolds analogy, heat-transfer rates can be computed which,with a few exceptions, are within 5 percent of values obtainedfrom computing-machine results .
