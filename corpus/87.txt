free-convection magnetohydrodynamic flow past a porous flat plate .the incompressible flow of an electrically conducting fluid past aporous plate with constant suction velocity in the presence of atransverse uniform strength has recently been investigated by gupta .  inthis note, the problem is generalized to take into account the effect offree convection, when a body force is acting parallel to the wall .  thefluid is assumed to be semi-incompressible as usual .  in addition tothe obvious practical significance, this problem is also interesting inthe sense that it provides another exact solution of themagnetohydrodynamic equations, since the only electromagnetic assumptions involvedare constant properties and freedom from excessive charges .
