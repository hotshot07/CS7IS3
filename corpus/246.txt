the design of minimum drag tip fins . with an appendix- on the conformal transformation of a wing with afin .  the report describes an investigation intothe design of minimum drag tip fins by lifting line theory .  thework is based on an exact solution of the conformaltransformation which is applicable to this problem following themethod of trefitz .  three types of solution are treated,corresponding to symmetrical upper and lower fins, singleupper or lower fins, and unequal upper and lower fins .a representative range of solutions for circulation distributionalong wing and fins has been calculated for each of thethree cases by the use of elliptic and theta functions .  a detailed account is given, with examples, of theprocedure for calculating the plan of wing and fins, the lift andinduced drag, and the setting of the fins .
