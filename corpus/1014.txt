principles of creep buckling weight-strength analysis .





principles of creep buckling weight-strength analysis .a problem of creep stability of columns and platesis considered .  in an analysis use is madeof two forms of the creep theory based on the strainhardening hypothesis .  for a uniformlycompressed palte a comparison is made between theresults according to the flow theory and straintheory .
