Text: on the solution of the laminar boundary layer equations .the problem of the flow along a flat plateplaced edgewise to a steady stream,when a retarding pressure gradientvarying linearly as the distance xfrom the leading edge of the plateis superposed is discussed .  if y denotesdistance measured perpendicular tothe plate, a solution is obtained in theform of a power series in x wherecoefficients are functions of .differential equations are obtained for thesecoefficients .  seven of the coefficientshave been obtained with reasonableaccuracy, and the eighth and ninthroughly .  unfortunately it appearsthat about eight more terms arerequired to carry the solution tothe point of separation,. the workinvolved in their determination isprohibitive .  two approximate methodshave been developed for determiningthe error when the first seven termsof the series are used as an approximation .these methods lead to thedetermination of the point of separationand are in agreement as to itsposition .  if is the velocity at theedge of the boundary layer at theleading edge of the plate and is thevelocity gradient, separation is foundwhen .  a method isdeveloped for the solution of theboundary layer equations in any retarded region .it is obtained byreplacing the velocity distribution at the edgeof the boundary layer by acircumscribing polygon of infinitesimal sides andapplying the preceding solutionto each of these sides, making themomentum integral continuous at eachvortex .  the problem is therebyreduced to the solution of a first orderdifferential equation .
