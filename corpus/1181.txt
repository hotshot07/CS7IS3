steady magnetohydrodynamic flow past a non-conductingwedge .  this paper presents a study of the steadytwo-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic flow of aninfinitely conducting fluid past a nonconductingwedge with nonaligned flow and magneticfield .  the flows considered are in the /superfast/or fully hyperbolic regime .  the flows consistof several regions of uniformity connected byshocks and expansion waves .  because of theboundary condition on the magnetic field, themagnetic field must be the same in the regionsabove and below the wedge,. thus the flows in theseregions are coupled, unlike in the case ofordinary supersonic gasdynamics .  only small wedgeangles and weak waves (characteristics) areconsidered .  the problem thus is linearized, andexplicit solutions are obtained which arequalitatively similar to the nonlinear solutions .some interesting and unexpected featuresarise, and they are discussed in detail .
