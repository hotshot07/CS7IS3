the homogeneous boundary layer at an axisymmetric stagnationpoint with large rates of injection .  this report presents a theoretical analysis of the boundarylayer at an axisymmetric stagnation point with large rates ofair injection .  the results of a previous investigation indicatedthat for localized mass transfer in the stagnation region, therates of injection are considerably greater than those usuallytreated .  the exact stagnation-point boundary-layer equationsare integrated numerically for an approximate representationof the gas properties .  the two-point boundary conditions aretreated in a new manner which is useful for variousboundary-layer and mixing problems .  the exact solutions indicate thatfor large rates of injection the boundary layer is closelyrepresented by an inner isothermal shear flow and by and exterior,relatively thin region, in which the flow variables change to theirfree-stream values .  an integral method based on profilessuggested by the exact solutions is developed and shown to leadto accurate predictions of the integral thicknesses which areof interest for a study of the downstream influence of thestagnation-point mass transfer .
