Text: low speed wind tunnel tests on a two dimensional aerofoilwith split flap near the ground .  pressure distributions have beenmeasured on a 10 thick two-dimensionalaerofoil of r.a.e.101 section fitted withsplit flaps deflected at 15 and 55 .measurements were made at two distancesabove a ground plate, and also withoutthe ground plate .  the results have beenintegrated to give the sectionallift, drag and pitching-moment coefficients .
