pressure distribution in regions of step-induced turbulentseparation .  an analysis is made of the pressure distribution in theseparated-flow region ahead of a step, using the concept of theturbulent mixing coefficient of crocco and lees and the /jet-flow/model of chapman with some modification .  on the basis ofa variable mixing coefficient, a differential equation for thepressure distribution is derived, which gives the pressure rise as afunction of the distance from the separation point .  thisequation contains the separation length as an unknown .  a secondequation is obtained by making a mass balance of the air enteringand, leaving the /dead-air/ region ahead of the step .  thepressure rise and the separation distance for a given machnumber are determined by solving the two equations simultaneously .  the analysis yields results which are in close agreement withthe experimental data on steps, obtained at princeton,particularly for m = 3.85 .  for lower mach numbers, a maximumvariation of 5 percent is found between theory and experiment .use of the velocity profiles of jets, as required by the jet-flowmodel, necessarily restricts the applicability of the present studyto flows with thin boundary layers at the separation point .
