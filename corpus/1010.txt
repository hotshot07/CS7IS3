Text: free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic .  air-flow properties in nozzles were calculated and charted forequilibrium flow and two types of frozen flows .  in one type of frozenflow, air was assumed to be in equilibrium from the nozzle reservoir toarbitrary points where chemical reactions and molecular vibrationsbecame frozen .  in the other type, it was assumed that molecularvibrations were in equilibrium throughout the nozzle and that chemicalreactions became frozen at arbitrary points .  the calculations weremade for a range of stagnation pressures up to 10,000 poinds per squareinch absolute and stagnation enthalpies up to 24,500 btu per pound .the flow properties charted were temperature, pressure, density,velocity, dynamic pressure, mach number, reynolds number, molecularweight fraction, and mass flow .  equilibrium flow properties throughnormal shock waves were also included .
