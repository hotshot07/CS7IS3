second-order theory for unsteady supersonic flow pastslender pointed bodies of revolution .  an analysis is made of the second-order effects of thickness onthe unsteady aerodynamic forces on a slender pointed body ofrevolution in supersonic flow .  the theory is restricted toharmonic oscillations for small angles of attack .  the solution isobtained by approximating the nonlinear terms in the second-orderpotential equation by their first-order values and solving theresulting inhomogeneous partial differential equation, subject tomore refined boundary conditions .  the pressure equation islikewise refined and integrated to give the second-ordercorrections to lift and pitching moment coefficients .  the analysis canbe considered as an extension of the second-order, slender bodytheory of lighthill to the case of unsteady flow .  the results indicate appreciable reductions in unsteady liftand damping moment coefficients when applied to slender cones .the present theory is estimated to be reliable provided thatis less than 0.7 .
