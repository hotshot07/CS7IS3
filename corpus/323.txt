vorticity interaction at an axisymmetric stagnationpoint in a viscous incompressible fluid .  the purpose of the present note is to give an exact solution ofthe incompressible navier-stokes equations at an axisymmetricstagnation point with vorticity in the oncoming flow which varieslinearly with distance from the axis .  this solution has applicationto the hypersonic axisymmetric blunt body problem, for whichlighthill has shown the vorticity in the inviscid shock layer isvery nearly of this form .
