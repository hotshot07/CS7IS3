tables of aerodynamic coefficients obtained from developed newtonianexpressions for complete and partial conic and spheric bodies atcombined angles of attack and sideslip with some comparisons withhypersonic experimental data .closed-form expressions and tables composed from these expressions arepresented for complete and partial conic and spheric bodies at combinedangles of attack and sideslip in newtonian flow . aerodynamiccoefficients of these bodies are tabulated for various body segmentsover a range of angles of attack from 1degree to 85degree and angles ofsideslip from 0degree to 15degree .some comparisons between newtonian predictions and hypersonicexperimental aerodynamic characteristics were made for conic bodieshaving various surface slopes, nose bluntnesses, and body cross sections to indicate the range of validity of the theory . in general, thetheory is shown to agree quite well with experimental results forsharp-nose complete cones and for configurations having large bluntednoses and steep surface slopes . however, agreement between theory andexperiment generally is poor for the more slender, slightly bluntedcomplete or half conic bodies and also for sharp-nose half conic bodieswhere real-flow phenomena such as forebody interference, viscous forces, leeward surface contributions, or leading-edge pressure reductions mayhave significant effect . the agreement between theory and experimentfor the bodies considered can be improved by using the stagnationpressure coefficient behind a normal shock rather than 2 as the newtoniancoefficient, although for the sharp-nose half conic bodies there is notheoretical justification for this modification .
