Text: axisymmetric viscous flow plast very slender bodiesof revolution .  axisymmetric viscous flow past unyawed very slender bodiesof revolution is treated within the category of the perfect gas .attention is paid especially to the effect of transverse curvatureof the body .  from the transformed equations, the similarityconditions are deduced, and the parameter characterizing theeffect of transverse curvature is obtained .  several numericalsolutions of similarity equations for hypersonic flows arepresented, and upon the basis of these results, the effect of thetransverse-curvature parameter is discussed .  a method ofapplying the local-similarity approximation to obtain theapproximate solution for nonsimilar cases is described, as arepractical applications to incompressible flow past a long cylinder andto hypersonic flow past a very slender cone .  comparison withexperimental results shows fair agreement with calculations usingthe local-similarity approximation in the present range ofexperimental flow conditions .
