Text: modulated entry .  the technique of modulation, or variable coefficients, is discussedand the analytical formulation is reviewed .  representative numericalresults of the use of modulation are shown for the lifting andnonlifting cases .  these results include the effects of modulation onpeak acceleration, entry corridor, and heat absorption .  results aregiven for entry at satellite speed and escape speed .  the indicationsare that coefficient modulation on a vehicle with good liftingcapability offers the possibility of sizable loading reductions or,alternatively, wider corridors,. thus, steep entries become practicalfrom the loading standpoint .  the amount of steepness depends on theacceptable heating penalty .  the price of sizable fractions of thepossible gains does not appear to be excessive .
