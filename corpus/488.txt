a reaction-rate parameter for gasdynamics of a chemicallyreacting gas mixture .  presented note proposes a linearized reaction rate parameterwhich is applicable to any reacting gas mixture provided all thepertinent reactions and their rate constants are known at thethermodynamic conditions under consideration .  linearizing isachieved by expanding equation of rate of chemical reaction in ataylor series and neglecting higher-order terms .  authorannounces that tables of linearized reaction rate parameters fordissociated and slightly ionized air are now in preparation at thespace sciences laboratory, general electric co., msvo .  comparison of preliminary results with exact calculationspublished by hall, i. g., et.al., /inviscid hypersonic air-flows withcoupled non-equilibrium processes/ (ias paper 62-67, 30thannual meeting, new york, jan. 1962) indicates good agreement .
