Text: heat transfer near the forward stagnation point ofa body of revolution .in order to determine the temperature distribution over abody moving through the atmosphere, a knowledge of thelocal heat-transfer coefficients is required .  for slendersharp-nosed bodies, the heat-transfer coefficients are frequentlyapproximated by using the comparable flat-plate values .however, for blunt-nosed bodies, flat-plate solutions are notapplicable near the forward stagnation point .  since the greatest rateof heat transfer may occur at the forward stagnation point, itsvalue should be investigated .  in this note a theoretical solutionis given for the heat transfer near the forward stagnation point ofa body of revolution assuming laminar, incompressible, low-speedflow .  the comparable solution for two-dimensional flow hasbeen given by squire .  in the case of a blunt-nosed body movingwith supersonic velocity, the flow behind the central portion ofthe bow wave is subsonic, and it is possible that a low-speedsolution, using as /free-stream/ conditions those behind the centerof the bow wave, will apply near the stagnation point .
