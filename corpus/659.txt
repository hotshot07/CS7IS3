nonuniform shear flow past cylinders .  a general method is described wherebyan approximation of any desired degreeof accuracy to the stream functions fortwo types of variable shear flows pastfinite cylinders can be obtained .  the twoshear distributions in the free stream canbe approximated to the linear sheardistribution and the shear present in anunretarded incompressible boundary layerrespectively .  in every case the stagnationstreamline is displaced from the positionopposite the line of symmetry of thecylinder, and general expressions areobtained for this displacement .  the line ofsymmetry may be in the direction ofor perpendicular to the direction of flow .the two particular examples cited arethose of a general elliptic cylinder andcylinders of the form where and being the polarcoordinates, and 2p the maximum widthof the cylinder .
