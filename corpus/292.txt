Text: rapid laminar boundary layer calculations by piece-wiseapplication of similar solutions .  a method is presented for the rapid calculation of theincompressible laminar boundary layer in an arbitrary flow aroundeither a two-dimensional or a rotationally-symmetrical body .the solution is obtained without recourse to von karman'smomentum equation by means of a coarse step-by-step procedurein which each segment of the velocity distribution isapproximated by one of the falkner-skan family of similar flows .  solutions have at least as much accuracy as those of any otherone-parameter approximate method, and in certain cases thesolutions become exact .  in regions of accelerating velocity, theaccuracy appears to be very high .  in decelerating flows,separation is predicted somewhat early compared with exact solutionsthat is, the method is conservative in contrast to the vonkarman-pohlhausen procedure which sometimes fails to predictseparation that actually exists .  the method is the most rapid hand procedure known to theauthor, provided the full history of the boundary layer isrequired .  if only a thickness such as is needed at one point on asurface, then it is about equal in speed to the quadrature method .but, if several values of or other properties along a surface arerequired, it is appreciably faster than the quadrature method .characteristically, only four steps are needed between the forwardstagnation point and the pressure peak .  once thevelocity-distribution data are available, each step in a two-dimensionalcalculation requires about 5 minutes, using a slide rule .
