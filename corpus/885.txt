buckling of thin cylindrical shells under hoop stressesvarying in axial direction .  the buckling of a thin cylindrical shell simply supportedalong the perimeter of its end sections is analyzed underhoop compressive stresses varying in the axial direction .the thermal stresses arising from a uniform increase inthe temperature of the cylinder are determined .  it isfound that such thermal stresses are not likely to causeelastic buckling .  simple approximate formulas aredeveloped for buckling stress and thermal stress .
