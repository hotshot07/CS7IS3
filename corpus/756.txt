Text: further comments on the inversion of large structural matrices .in a recent note, klein referred to a paper co-authored by the writer,and to ref. 3 .  regarding the subject of inversion of large-ordermatrices, klein stated that he would show 'that the situation is not ashopeless as the anove-mentioned authors intimate' .the purpose of this note is not to take exception to klein/sconclusions, but rather to disagree with his implication that theauthors of ref. 2 were pessimistic with respect to large-matrixinversions .  two general methods of analysis were treated..  themethod of consistent distortion and the method of transfer matrices .the first method leads directly to a relatively large matrix ofstructural coefficients of both internal forces and displacements .this matrix must be inverted to solve the problem .  the second methodultimately produces a relatively small matrix requiring inversion.,however, to arrive at this point one must perform a number of matrixmultiplications .
