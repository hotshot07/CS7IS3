Text: experimental effect of bluntness and gas rarefactionon drag coefficients and stagnation heat transfer onaxisymmetric shapes in hypersonic flow .  inverted hemispheres, circular discs (normal to stream),spheres, 26 total angle 0.368 blunt hemisphere cones, 18total-angle sharp cones, and other axisymmetric shapes were run in ahypervelocity wind tunnel .  hypersonic drag coefficients at zeroangle of attack were measured in the air velocity range, 7,000-efficient is defined as drag force .  knudsen number isdefined as mean free path behind shock sphere shockdetachment distance .  in the case of nonsphere shapes, the knudsennumber is defined as the knudsen number of a sphere with thesame base diameter .  these drag coefficients cover the range of gasdynamics to freemolecule flow and are given in graphical form .  the dragcoefficients were measured by means of a ballistic balance inmillisecond intervals, and referenced to the drag coefficient of asphere in the gasdynamics region, for a gamma of 1.4, of 0.92 .  tunnel stagnation conditions of pressure, temperature, density,and pressure drop with time were measured directly .  in thetunnel test section, velocity, q density, total pressure, and staticpressure were measured directly .  these experimental curves have been found useful in theanalysis of complex shapes if the complex shapes can be easily brokendown into simple components with small interactions betweencomponents .  heat-transfer distributions have also been obtained on theseand other complex shapes in the hypervelocity wind tunnel, bymeans of a special paint which changes through several visiblespectral orders within a heat transfer range of x10 for a singleapplication .  heat transfer rates, so obtained, have beenperformed in the hypersonic gasdynamic and slip flow regions andare presented for spheres .  these data, in the vorticity interactionregion, agree with the data of ferri and zakkay .
