Text: transition in the viscous wakes of blunt bodies athypersonic speeds .  transition from laminar to turbulent flow in the hypersonicwakes of spheres was detected in laboratory measurements of theradiation from the flow field .  a hypervelocity gun facility wasused to fire models, 0.22-in. in diameter, into a range at velocitiesfrom 10,000 to 17,000 ft sec .  experiments were performed bychanging ..  (a) the material of the projectile ,. (b) the ambientgas in the range ,. and (c) the pressure in the range .  threeoptical techniques were used to observe the wake radiation ..which show a turbulent viscous wake as the pressure in therange is decreased from one atmosphere to about 20 cm hg .which show the luminous flow field at pressures between 30 andence of short luminous streaks, which disappear suddenly as thepressure is decreased below 3 cm hg for air, and below 0.8 cmhg for argon .both air and argon, which show the main features of the flowfield .  above the transition pressure, the intensity of radiationfrom the wake is always associated with fluctuations that appearto be the same phenomenon as the drum-camera streaks .  the appearance of the streaks in the drum camera andphoto-multiplier data is interpreted as transition from laminar toturbulent flow in the viscous wake, because experimental evidenceshows that their appearance is not controlled by chemical,radiative, or ablative processes, but depends on aerodynamiceffects .  this conclusion is supported by other experiments basedon optical and schlieren techniques .  the transition in the wakeat positions very close to the body is given by a local reynoldsnumber of 10 for air, and 3 x 10 for argon .  the results indicatea possible local-mach-number effect .
