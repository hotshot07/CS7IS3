Text: convection of a pattern of vorticity through a shockwave .  an arbitrary weak spatial distribution of vorticity can berepresented in terms of plane sinusoidal shear waves of all orientations andwave lengths (fourier integral) .  the analysis treats the passage of asingle representative weak shear wave through a plane shock and showsrefraction and modification of the shear wave with simultaneousgeneration of an acoustically intense soundwave .  applications to turbulenceand to noise in supersonic wind tunnels are indicated .
