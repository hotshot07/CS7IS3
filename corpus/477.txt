Text: laminar boundary layers at the interface of co-currentparallel streams .  the approximate solution of keulegan(1) for the steady flow of astream of viscous incompressible fluid over another at rest is extendedto the case where both fluids are moving co-current but at differentvelocities .  this solution utilizes a sextic polynomial for thevelocity distribution in the boundary layers .  the solutions dependonly on the ratio of the velocities of the two streams and on theproduct of the corresponding viscosity and density ratios .  numericalresults are given for seven values of at one value of .  lock(2) haspublished an exact solution with a numerical result for and the sexticpolynomial solution is evaluated f40umerical result for and the sexticindicates that in general the sextic polynomial is more accurate thanthe quartic polynomial but that the advantage is not great .
