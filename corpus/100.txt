vibration isolation of aircraft power plants .vibration in aircraft structure can almostalways be traced to vibratory forces originatingfrom the power plant .  these forces are transmittedto the aircraft in two ways ..  (1) by the action of airforces upon the surfaces of the aircraft in, or adjacentto, the slip stream of the propeller, and (2) by directtransmission of unbalanced forces from the powerplant through the engine mounting .  the latter hasalways caused the preponderance of disturbance .vibratory stresses induced in the engine mountingstructure occasionally produce fatigue failures in theassociated parts, and always shorten the useful lifeof the entire aircraft structure .  more important,however, are the psychological and physiologicaleffects of continuous vibration and its attendant noiseon the passengers and crew .  this may very likelybe the major source of the rapid fatigue which is sointimately associated with flying .  the importanceand desirability of drastically reducing vibration canhardly be questioned .  this paper is limited to a consideration of thedirectly transmitted forces and, further, considers thepower plants as rigid bodies attached by flexible meansto the aircraft which is also considered as a rigid bodyof relatively large mass .  it is also limited to the caseof engines and engine supporting structures havingaxial symmetry (radial engines), although the methodsemployed could easily be extended to other cases .
