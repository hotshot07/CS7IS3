Text: summary of laminar boundary layer solutions forwedge-type flow over convection and transpiration cooledsurfaces .  a summary of exact solutions of thelaminar-boundary-layer equationsfor wedge-type flow, useful in estimatingheat transfer to sucharbitrarily shaped bodies as turbine blades,is presented .  the solutions aredetermined for small mach numbers anda prandtl number at the wall of 0.7 ,.ranges of mainstream pressure gradientsand rates of coolant flow througha porous wall are considered for thefollowing cases ..  (1) smalltemperature changes in the boundary layeralong a constant- and along avariable-temperature wall, and (2) largetemperature changes in the boundary layeralong a constant-temperature wall .  dimensionless forms of heat-transferand friction parameters andboundary-layer thicknesses are tabulated .the results indicate thatcoolant emission and increased stream-to-walltemperature ratios diminishedthe friction and heat transfer for aconstant wall temperature .  for avariable wall temperature with smalltemperature differences in theboundary layer, the friction was unaffected,but the heat transfer was greatlyincreased for increased wall-temperaturegradient .  heat-transfer resultsin the literature reveal that transpirationcooling is much more effectivefor prandtl numbers of the order of 5.0 than for 0.7 .
