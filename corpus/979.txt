correlation of base pressure and wake structure ofsharp and blunt-nose cones with reynolds number basedon boundary layer momentum thickness .it has been established in the past that there is a certainrelationship between base pressure and boundary-layerbehavior .  the base-pressure and wake-flow conditions werefound to be dependent upon the local flow characteristics at thesurface of supersonic vehicles directly upstream of the base or ofthe region of wake-flow separation .  in order to use existing data on cones and other shapes topredict wake angle and base pressure on blunt bodies, an attempt wasmade recently at the naval ordnance laboratory to establisha unique relationship between given local flow conditions at thedownstream end of sharp and blunt cones at supersonic speedsand the corresponding wake-flow conditions with zero heattransfer .
