effects of jet billowing on stability of missile-typebodies at mach 3. 85 .  the interference effects of abillowing jet on the forces andmoments of two missile-type bodieswere investigated in the nasa lewis2-by 2-foot mach 3.85 wind tunnel .to simulate a rocket jet, pressurizednitrogen was exhausted from anannular sonic nozzle .  the results indicate that forboth models the stability parametermoment coefficient with angle ofattack) in the region of zero angleof attack was favorably influencedby the interference resulting fromseparation due to jet billowing .schlieren photographs are presentedthat show the separation due to thejet billowing at various pressureratios and angles of attack .
