Text: recent studies on the effect of cooling on boundarylayer transition at mach 4.the advent of high-speed flight has necessitated the study ofboundary-layer transition on highly cooled bodies .investigations such as those of references 1-4 have concentratedon this problem and have indicated, contrary to the trendspredicted by small-disturbance theory, that premature transitioncan be found with cooling .  this phenomenon, commonly calleddetail in references 2-5 .  the purpose of this note is to report some recent transitiondata obtained on a cooled cone in a mach 4 wind tunnel .  themodel, a sharp-tip cone (included angle 13.5), was cooled byliquid nitrogen to a temperature of -340 f .  the coolingmethod and the data analysis are similar to that described inreference 3 .
