Text: nose drag in free-molecule flow and its minimization .  the superaerodynamic nose drag of a body in a free-moleculeflow involves two parameters ..  the speed ratio s betweenordered and random molecular motions (modified machnumber), and the temperature ratio between the solid surfaceand undisturbed gas .  simplifications of the drag formula areobtained at hypersonic as well as low-subsonic extremes .  tominimize the drag on a nose of specified length and base radius,the ordinary method of calculus of variation was foundinadequate .  a generalized approach has, accordingly, been developed,and the specification of end conditions is discussed at length .  results of the present investigation indicate that in all casesan optimum nose requires a flat tip .  the optimum nose curvefor the hypersonic extreme does not depend on the temperatureratio, but that for the low-subsonic extreme varies in thefollowing manner ..  for a hot body the curve is convex,. for a cold body,concave .  an optimum solution exists in a restricted range ofspecification only .  with prescribed tip and base radii theadmissible nose length is bounded below for the cases of hypersonicand low-subsonic hot body and bounded above for the case oflow-subsonic cold body .  a vanishing tip radius leads to aninfinitely long nose in the former and a vanishing nose in the lattercase .  optimum nose curves for several temperature ratios at thelow-subsonic extreme, as well as the one for hypersonic extreme, arepresented .  it is observed that at the low-subsonic extreme, with,the hot-body solution asymptotically approachesthe hypersonic solution--i.e., a slender conventional warheadwith a flat tip,. whereas with, the cold-body solutionasymptotically approaches the minimal-surface solution--i.e.,tip radius, a flat disc .
