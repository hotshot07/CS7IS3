influence of the leading-edge shock wave on the laminar boundary layerat hypersonic speeds .in order to bring out the importance of the leading-edge region athypersonic speeds, the influence of the leading-edge shock wave onthe laminar boundary layer is investigated in two simple cases ofsteady flow over a semi-infinite, insulated flat plate..  (1) sharpleading edge., (2) blunt leading edge, as approximated by a normalshock wave .  the streamlines that enter the boundary layer over a largeregion of the plate surface has previously crossed the shock wavevery near the leading-edge, where the shock is strong and highlycurved .  consequently, the temperature at the outer edge of theboundary layer is appreciably higher than free-stream temperature,and the vorticity there is not zero .  the effects of this shock-wavelarger than the usual /errors/ made in the boundary-layer theory,and an estimate of these effects can therefore be obtained within theframework of that theory .  the numerical magnitude of the shock-waveinfluence is found to be appreciable .  for the case of the bluntleading edge the slope of the curve of induced pressures plotted againstthe hypersonic interaction parameter closely approaches the experimentaldata of hammitt and bogdonoff obtained in helium at large values of thisparameter .  these approximate results show that the influence of theleading-edge region at hypersonic speeds requires careful theoreticaland experimental study .
