magnetohydrodynamic shock waves .  an interpretation of the de hoffman-teller shock-waveequations for an infinitely conductingmedium is given analogous to the classical interpretation ofthe ordinary hydrodynamic shock-waveequations of rankine and hugoniot .  two cases of interestare considered as a consequence of this theory .it is shown that weak magnetic fields in interstellar cloudswill be amplified, and, if external mechanismsare available to reduce the compressional effects of shockwaves, the field will reach a value,where p is the pressure .  also, some aspects of the internalmotions of prominences are considered ,. it isshown that gauss will yield results in accord withthe observational material .
