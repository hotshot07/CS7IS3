Text: the behaviour of supersonic flow past a body of revolutionfar from the axis .a theory is developed of the supersonic flow past a body of revolutionat large distances from the axis, where a linearized approximation isvalueless owing to the divergence of the characteristics at infinity .it is used to find the asymptotic forms of the equations of the shockswhich are formed from the neighbourhoods of the nose and tail .  in thespecial case of a slender pointed body, the general theory at largedistances is used to modify the linearized approximation to give atheory which is uniformly valid at all distances from the axis .  theresults which are of physical importance are summarized in theconclusion (9) and compared with the results of experimentalobservations .
