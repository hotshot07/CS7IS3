simplified method for determination of the criticalheight of distributed roughness particles for boundarylayer transition at mach numbers from 0 to 5.  a simplified method has been devised for determination of thecritical height of three-dimensional roughness particles required topromote premature transition of a laminar boundary layer on models ofairplanes or airplane components in a wind tunnel with zero heattransfer .  a single equation is derived which relates the roughness heightto a reynolds number based on the roughness height and on local flowconditions at the height of the roughness, and charts are presentedfrom which the critical roughness height can be easily obtained formach numbers from 0 to 5 .  a discussion of the use of these charts ispresented with consideration of various model configurations .  the method has been applied to various types of configurations inseveral wind-tunnel investigations conducted by the national advisorycommittee for aeronautics at mach numbers up to 4, and in all casesthe calculated roughness height caused premature boundary-layertransition for the range of test conditions .
