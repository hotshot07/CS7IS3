Text: linearised transonic flow about slender bodies at zeroangle of attack .  the simple linearized transonic flow theoryas originally proposed by oswatitsch andkeune(1) and by the present authors (2)is improved by considering and partiallycorrecting its error .  in this manner a theorywhich is easy to apply and which shouldbe valid for a great number of smooth bodiesis obtained .  this improved theorypredicts shock waves in the lower transonic regions .it is applied to a number of significantbody and airfoil shapes and its predictions arecompared with experiments and resultsof other theoretical investigations .
