method of analysis for compressible flow through mixed-flow centrifugalimpellers of arbitrary design .a method is presented for analysis of the compressible flow between thehub and the shroud of mixed-flow impellers of arbitrary design . axialsymmetry was assumed, but the forces in the meridional /hub to shroud/plane, which are derived from tangential pressure gradients, were takeninto account .the method was applied to an experimental mixed-flow impeller . theanalysis of the flow in the meridional plane of the impeller showed that the rotational forces, the blade curvature, and the hub-shroud profilecan introduce severe velocity gradients along the hub and the shroudsurfaces . choked flow at the impeller inlet as determined by theanalysis was verified by experimental results .
