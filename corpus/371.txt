note on tip-bluntness effects in the supersonic andhypersonic regimes .in a recent letter, m. h. bertram presents some data onflows at m = 6.85 around 10 half-angle cones with bluntedtips .  since the demarcation between the supersonic andhypersonic regimes is not sharp and since one expects hypersonic flowsto be generally similar to those at lower mach numbers--especially where viscous effects do not predominate throughout theentire field of interest--it is of some value to compare bertram'sresults with those obtained by giese and bergdolt for 15half-angle cones at m = 2.45 .  following the observation by chartersand stein that drag coefficient measurements on blunted conesimply a reynolds number effect, giese and bergdolt study theconvergence to conical flow of the perturbed flow about a conewith truncated tip .  they employ the mach-zehnderinterferometer and the conical flow criterion as analytical tools .
