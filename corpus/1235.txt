a theory of the two dimensional laminar bounary layerover a curved surface .  the purpose of this paper is to present a theory to account forsurface curvature effects on the two-dimensional boundary-layerflow which approaches a potential flow at free stream .  the problem of two-dimensional viscous flow is first formulatedby using the streamlines and their orthogonal trajectories as thegeneralized coordinates .  a boundary-layer approximation isapplied to the navier-stokes equations and the gauss equationin the generalized coordinates to yield the boundary-layerequations .  the conditions under which similar solutions of theboundary-layer equations exist are determined .  by a simpletransformation, the governing differential equation can beexpressed in a form which reduces to the falkner-skan equationfor zero surface curvature .  numerical results for a similar solution which corresponds to aflow over a curved surface with zero surface pressure gradienthave been obtained .  the velocity profiles in the boundary layerand the wall skin-friction distribution for concave and convexsurfaces are presented .  the wall skin friction for a convex wallis found to be higher than the blasius value for a flat plate .  onthe other hand, for a concave wall, the skin friction will dropbelow the blasius value as the curvature increases, but it appears toreach a minimum, and beyond this minimum point it will increaseagain .  the same flow problem was treated by murphy by adifferent method of analysis .  comparison of murphy's resultswith those obtained by the present method reveals some basicdifferences in the boundary-layer characteristics .  in particular,murphy's results indicate that the wall skin friction for a convexsurface is smaller than the blasius value, while for a concave wallit is higher .
