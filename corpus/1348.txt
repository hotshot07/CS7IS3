radiative heat transfer during atmosphere entry atparabolic velocity .  stagnation point radiative heatingrates for manned vehicles enteringthe earth's atmosphere at parabolicvelocity are presented and comparedwith corresponding laminar convectiveheating rates .  the calculationswere made for both nonlifting and liftingentry trajectories for vehiclesof varying nose radius, weight-to-arearatio, and drag .  it is concludedfrom the results presented that radiativeheating will be important forthe entry conditions considered .
