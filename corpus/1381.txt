effect of mach number on boundary layer transitionin the presence of pressure rise and surface roughnesson an ogive-cylinder body with cold wall conditions .  the effect of mach number variationfrom 1.8 to 7.4 on boundary-layertransition was investigated on a slenderfin-stabilized ogive-cylinderbody in free flight at a constant lengthreynolds number of 13.8 million .the wall to free-stream temperature ratiowas constant at a value of 1.0below mach number 4.5 and at a value ofof the test showed that increasing machnumber had a very favorable effectof increasing the extent of the laminarboundary layer for a given surfaceroughness .  the transition data, whenplotted as a function of a factorindicative of heat transfer, showed thatheat transfer was possiblyresponsible for a good deal of the increase intransition reynolds number withmach number .  transition was found to occurfarther forward on the sheltered sideof the body than on the windward sidefor angles of attack as low as 0.4and for all mach numbers .  the pressurerise along sheltered-sidestream-lines was examined and it was foundthat the pressure-rise coefficientat the transition point, showed novariation with mach number .  data fromother sources for different testconditions, when reduced to values ofpressure-rise coefficient, were alsofound to correlate well with that ofthe present investigation with theexception of data at low subsonic machnumbers .  these present results alsoshow that mach number, surfaceroughness, pressure rise, and length reynoldsnumber all affected boundary-layertransition in the region of theoreticalinfinite laminar stability tosmall two-dimensional disturbances ascalculated for a flat plate withzero pressure gradient .
