hypersonic nozzle expansion of air with atom recombinationpresent .  an experimental investigation on the expansion of high-temperature, high-pressure air to hypersonic flow mach numbers ina conical nozzle of a hypersonic shock tunnel has been carried out .the equilibrium temperature and pressure ranges after thereflected shock wave were 1400 to 6000 k and 100 to 1000 psia .static-pressure measurements, which are sensitive to the stateof the gas, were made along the axis of the nozzle for differentreservoir conditions .  these results are compared with thecalculated equilibrium and /frozen/ data for the same geometryand initial reservoir conditions .  for reservoir pressures greater than 500 psia, the expansion ofthe air in the nozzle is essentially in equilibrium up to reservoirtemperatures of about 4,500 k .  for temperatures greater thanalmost frozen .  at a given area ratio for the nozzle and reservoirpressure, the expansion process remains in equilibrium up to acertain reservoir temperature, and beyond this temperature theflow expansion deviates rapidly from the equilibrium process andapproaches the frozen case .
