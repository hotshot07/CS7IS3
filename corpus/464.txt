Text: flow studies on flat plate delta wings at supersonicspeeds .  an experimental study has been made to investigate some aspectsof the nature of the flow around delta wings .  vapor-screen,pressure-distribution, and ink-flow studies were made at a mach number of 1.9 ona series of semispan delta-wing models with slender wedge airfoilsections and very sharp leading edges .  the models had semiapex anglesranging from 5 to 31.75 .  separated regions of vorticity existed along the chords of allthe wings in the series tested .  concentrated vortex cores were foundonly on wings of very small semiapex angles .  for wings with mediumand large semiapex angles, the separated vorticity was concentrated ina region extending over the outboard part of the span and lying closeto the wing upper surface .  the results show that theoretical aerodynamic calculations, suchas those in naca tn 3430, utilizing a single, separated vortex pairabove the wing upper surface to represent the separated vorticity canbe applied at supersonic speeds for very slender wings .
