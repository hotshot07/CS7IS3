some effects of injection of foreign gases in a deceleratinglaminar boundary layer in supersonic flow .  the purpose of this research program was to investigate theeffects of a diffusion field on a laminar boundary layer in asupersonic flow .  specifically, helium, nitrogen, and argon wereuniformly injected into the laminar boundary layer of ahigh-speed flow in a tube with the objective of determining the effectsof such injection on the pressure, temperature, and recoveryfactor distribution along and downstream of the injection region .  a continuously operating axially-symmetric wind tunnel hasbeen designed, constructed, and operated .  this tunnel consistsof an air supply system, a flowmeter, an upstream stagnationtank, a supersonic nozzle (throat diameter 0.262 and exitdiameter 1.400), a test section of variable length (zero to 81 diameters,test section diameter of 1.400), a downstream stagnation tank,an exhaust system, a foreign gas supply system, and all necessaryinstrumentation .  the overall performance of this apparatus interms of the design specifications was excellent .  the tunnel was instrumented with 109 thermocouples .  alltemperatures except ambient temperatures were automaticallymeasured and recorded by means of a self-balancing recordingpotentiometer .  there was 29 pressure taps distributed along thetunnel, 23 along the test section itself .  pressures were measuredby means of an interconnected micromanometer and a vacuumreferenced manometer system with overlapping ranges .  for all of the results reported herein, the overall test sectionwas 41 diameters in length,. composed of a porous test sectionapproximately 7.2 diameters in length (leading edgeapproximately 1.8 diameters from the nozzle exit plane) and four nylontest sections of 8 diameters each .
