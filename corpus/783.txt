Text: a method for calculating the subsonic steady-state loading on anairplane with a wing of arbitrary planform and stiffness .a method for computing the steady-state span load distribution on anelastic airplane wing for specified airplane weights and load factors is given . the method is based on a modification of the weissingerl-method and applies at subcritical mach numbers . it includes the effects of external stores and fuselage on the spanwise loading .modifications are outlined for treating tail-boom and tailless airplaneconfigurations and for calculating the divergence dynamic pressure of aswept wing with a large external store . a method is also outlined forreducing wind-tunnel data to obtain effective aerodynamic coefficientswhich are free of model flexibility effects . the effects of mach number can readily be evaluated from the aerodynamic coefficients thusobtained .
