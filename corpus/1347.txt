approximate analysis of atmospheric entry corridorsand angles .  a simple closed-form solutionfor the achievable corridor depthsand entry angles as a function ofg-load limit, entry velocity, andvehicle aerodynamics and thermodynamicsis developed for two modes ofvehicle operation, constant angleof attack and modulated angle of attack .  for constant angle of attack,operation at maximum negative liftcoefficient on the overshoot bound,and at an angle of attack betweenzero and that for maximum lift-dragratio on the undershoot bound, givesthe deepest corridor .  for modulatedangle of attack, operating atmaximum negative lift coefficient on theovershoot bound and modulatingthe angle of attack from maximumpositive lift coefficient to zero onthe undershoot bound give the deepestcorridor .  the modulated angle ofattack gives corridor depths two tofour times larger than the fixedangle of attack .  for both cases thecorridor depth is increased byincreasing maximum lift-drag ratio,increasing g limit, and decreasingentry velocity .  consideration of hot-gas radiationplaces a limit on the maximumangle of attack for either mode ofoperation .  if a maximum free-streamreynolds number limit must be placedon the vehicle to ensure a laminarboundary layer, the deep atmosphericpenetrations associated withconfigurations with high lift-drag ratiomay be ruled out .  both of thesethermodynamic considerations reducethe acceptable corridor depth belowthe value calculated from aerodynamicconsiderations alone .
