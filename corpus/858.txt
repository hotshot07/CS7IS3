Text: experimental investigation at mach numbers 3. 0 ofthe effects of thermal stress and buckling on the flutterof four-bay aluminium alloy panels with length-widthratios of 10 .  skin-stiffener aluminum alloy panels consisting of four bays, eachbay having a length-width ratio of 10, were tested at a mach numberof 3.0 at dynamic pressures ranging from 1,500 psf to 5,000 psf and atstagnation temperatures from 300 f to 655 f .  the panels wererestrained by the supporting structure in such a manner that partial thermalexpansion of the skins could occur in both the longitudinal and lateraldirections .  a boundary faired through the experimental flutter pointsconsisted of a flat-panel portion, a buckled-panel portion, and atransition point at the intersection of the two boundaries .  in the regionwhere a panel must be flat when flutter occurs, an increase in panelskin temperature (or midplane compressive stress) makes the panel moresusceptible to flutter .  in the region where a panel must be buckledwhen flutter occurs, the flutter trend is reversed .  this reversal intrend is attributed to the panel postbuckling behavior .
