Text: laminar heat-transfer and pressure measurements ata mach number of 6 on sharp and blunt 15 half-anglecones at angles of attack up to 90 .  two circular conical configurationshaving 15 half-angles weretested in laminar boundary layer at amach number of 6 and angles ofattack up to 90 .  one cone had a sharpnose and a fineness ratio ofblunted nose with a bluntness ratioof 0.1428 and a fineness ratio of 1.66 .pressure measurements andschlieren pictures of the flow showedthat near-conical flow existed upto an angle of attack of approximatelynear the base and the bow shockwave was considerably curved .  comparison of the results withsimply applied theories showed thaton the stagnation line pressures maybe predicted by newtonian theory,and heat transfer by local yawed-cylindertheory based on the yaw angleof the windward generator and the localradius of the cone .  base effectsincreased the heat transfer in a regionextending forward approximatelycircumferential pressuredistributions were higher than thecorresponding newtonian distributionand a better prediction was obtainedby modifying the theory to matchthe pressure at 90 from the windwardgenerator to that on the surfaceof the cone at an angle of attack of 0 .circumferential heat-transferdistributions were predicted satisfactorilyup to about 60 from thestagnation line by using lees' heat-fluxdistribution based on thenewtonian pressure .  the effects of nosebluntness at large angles ofattack were very small in the regionbeyond two nose radii from thepoint of tangency .
