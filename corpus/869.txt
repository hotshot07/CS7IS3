Text: the calculation of transient temperature in turbineblades and tapered discs using biot's variational method .  transient temperatures in aerofoilsections and tapered discs arecalculated taking advantage of simplificationsin heat flow analysisachieved in biot's variational method .cross-sections are represented bya line of adjacent squares of varioussizes suitable for the localdimensions, e.g. small squares near the leadingand trailing edges .  thepotential, dissipation and surface dissipationfunctions of biot's method areset up, and the lagrange equations lead,by automatic procedures, to aneigenvalue formulation in matrix form forthe temperatures and their firsttime derivatives .  solutions are sumsof exponentials in time, and areevaluated by digital computer, requiringabout five minutes for eachcross-section and heat transfer coefficient .transient temperatures in aparticular aerofoil section for variationof heat transfer coefficient and forexternal temperature depending exponentiallyon time agree with resultsobtained on an analogue computer .maximum transient temperaturedifferences are evaluated for tapered discsby a simple electrical analogue) withvariation of edge radius and heattransfer coefficient .  peculiaritiesin the solution for cyclictemperature external to an aerofoil overa range of frequencies indicatelimitations in the mathematical formulation .a successful solution for cyclicexternal temperature might enableeigenvalues to be separated out inexperimental measurements usingelectronic equipment, and this might beextended to exponential externaltemperature if a relationship betweencyclic and exponential externaltemperature could be established .eigenvalues and eigenvectors as discretevalues arise fictitiously from thesub-division into squares and thepossibility of an integral formulationis mentioned .  there is a possible,but not immediate, extension tocooled blades, whose cross-sectionsare multiply-connected regions .transient stresses due to creep, andviscoelasticity might be included .
