Text: interaction effects produced by jet exhausting laterally near base ofogive-cylinder model in supersonic main stream .the experimentally determined interaction effects of a side jetexhausting near the base of an ogive-cylinder model are presented anddiscussed . the interaction force appears to be independent ofmain-stream mach number, boundary-layer condition /laminar or turbulent/,angle of attack, and forebody length . the ratio of interaction force to jet force is found to be inversely proportional to the square root ofthe product of jet stagnation-to-free-stream pressure ratio and jet-to-body diameter ratio .
