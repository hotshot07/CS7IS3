Text: flow pattern in a converging-diverging nozzle .  the present report describes a new method for the predictionof the flow pattern of a gas in the two-dimensional and axiallysymmetrical case .  it is assumed that the expansion of the gas isadiabatic and the flow stationary .  the several assumptionsnecessary on the nozzle shape effect, in general, no essentiallimitation on the conventional nozzles .  the method is applicablethroughout the entire speed range,. the velocity of sound itselfplays no singular part .  the principal weight is placed on thetreatment of the flow near the throat of a converging-divergingnozzle .  for slender nozzles formulas are derived for thecalculation of the velocity components as function of the location .
