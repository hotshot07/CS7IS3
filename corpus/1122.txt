Text: on the role of initial imperfections in plastic bucklingof cylinders under axial compression .in a recent paper lee treated the complex problem of theplastic buckling and postbuckling behavior of an axiallycompressed cylindrical shell containing initial imperfections,representing an important step forward in our understanding of thiscommon, yet perplexing, structural element .  lee drew twomajor conclusions ..  (a) even with initial imperfections theincremental theory of plasticity considerably overestimates thebuckling strength as compared with the deformation theory,which is in substantially good agreement with experiments, andstrength of cylindrical shells subject to axial compression aresignificant .  it is the purpose of this note to discuss the second conclusionin terms of lee's experimental and theoretical results, otherexperimental data on inelastic buckling of 7075-t6aluminum-alloy cylinders, and recent theoretical results on the inelasticbuckling of cylinders in the axisymmetric and circumferentialmodes .  in particular, this writer does not believe that lee hasproved that initial imperfections are important for the groupof cylinders that he has tested .  on the contrary, it is believedthat initial imperfections are completely insignificant for thisgroup of cylinders although of probable significance in othercases .
