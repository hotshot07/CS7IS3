Text: laminar jet mixing of two compressible fluids with heat release .the laminar jet mixing problems with heat release have been formulated .a general discussion of the solution of these problems is also given .the important parameters of these problems are brought out .  somespecific cases of the jet mixing problem, such as jet mixing of onecompressible fluid, isothermal jet mixing of two compressible fluids,and isovel jet mixing of two compressible fluids with heat release, arediscussed in detail.
