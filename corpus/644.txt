Text: a study of the cantilever square plate subjected toa uniform loading .  plate problems involving free edges have been historicallydifficult to solve, particularly when two free edges are adjacent,resulting in a free corner .  the cantilevered square platesubjected to a transverse loading is one such problem for which anexact solution has not been achieved .  in the present paper results obtained by various approximatemethods are presented for this problem for the case of a uniformloading .  solutions obtained by the authors using the techniqueof point matching and the rayleigh-ritz method are comparedwith previously published finite-difference and experimentalresults and with bernoulli-euler beam and plane-strain approaches .numerical results for deflections, slope components, bending andtwisting moments, and transverse distributed shears are presentedfor a relatively fine gridwork of points on the plate boundaryand within the interior .  the antielastic curvature is exhibited byall methods except beam theory .  all methods present theinteresting conclusion that the free edge deflection is greater whenthe plate is treated as a plate rather than a beam .
