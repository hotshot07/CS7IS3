pressure distributions . axially symmetric bodies inoblique flow .  a simple picture, known from the work of i. lotz, of the flow overthe forward part of a body of revolution in oblique flow is derivedhere from entirely elementary considerations .  the pressure at anypoint of the (forward part of the) body at any angle of incidencedepends on three parameters whose values vary along the body .  thevariation of these parameters along the body can be determined from arelatively small number of wind tunnel or water tunnel measurements .the necessary water tunnel measurements have been made for four axiallysymmetric head shapes .  additional measurements have been made toillustrate the theoretical conclusions .  the data for each head shapeare adequate for a determination of the pressure coefficient at anypoint on the head shapes at any angle of incidence (up to 6, say) .in particular they can be used to determine the peak suction at anyangle of incidence and so the conditions for the onset of cavitationon the head .
