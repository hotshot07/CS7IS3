Text: turbulent heat transfer through a highly cooled, partiallydissociated boundary layer .  the problem of heat transfer from high-temperature airthrough a turbulent boundary layer to a cold surface isconsidered both analytically and experimentally .  heat-transferdata obtained in shock tubes are presented and correlated by asemiempirical theory which includes the effect of atomic diffusion .  the distinguishing characteristics of turbulent boundarylayers with dissociation and large cooling are considered .  it isshown that the equations governing such flow, after certainapproximations, can be represented in a form similar to theclassical equations for a turbulent boundary layer .  an approximate theory is proposed for turbulent heat transferfor a highly cooled boundary layer on portions of the body wherethe pressure gradient is negligible in the case of blunted bodiesof revolution in high-speed flight .  experimental results obtained on the cylindrical portion of ahemisphere-cylinder model are presented for conditionssimulating flight speeds to 21,350 ft. sec., where up to 30 per cent ofthe molecules are dissociated .  reynolds numbers of 2.5 x 10,based on local fluid properties external to the boundary layer,were achieved .  the larger values of reynolds number andflight speed were not obtained simultaneously, due to structurallimitations of the shock tubes,. however, the experiments wereconducted in such a way that the important effects of each couldbe determined .  in the experiments the mach number external to theboundary layer varied between 1.7 and 2.2 .  the corresponding machnumber for blunted nonslender bodies in flight would have amaximum value between 2.5 and 4,. however, it is shown thatthese differences in mach number are not important for suchbodies .
