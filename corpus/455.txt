Text: modified cross-lees mixing theory for supersonic separatedand reattaching flows .  re-examination of the crocco-lees method has shown that theprevious quantitative disagreement between theory andexperiment in the region of flow up to separation was caused primarilyby the improper c(k) relation assumed .  a new c(k) correlation,based on low-speed theoretical and experimental data and onsupersonic experimental results has been developed and found tobe satisfactory for accurate calculation of two-dimensional,laminar, supersonic flows up to separation .a physical model which incorporates the concept of the /dividing/streamline and the results of experiment .  according to thisphysical model, viscous momentum transport is the essentialmechanism in the zone between separation and the beginning ofreattachment, while the reattachment process is, on the contrary,an essentially inviscid process .  this physical model has beentranslated into crocco-lees languages using a semiempiricalapproach, and approximate c(k) and f(k) relations have beendetermined for the separated and reattaching regions .  theresults of this analysis have been applied to the problem ofshockwave, laminar-boundary-layer interaction, and satisfactory  a study of separated and reattaching regions of flow has led toquantitative agreement with experiment has been achieved .
