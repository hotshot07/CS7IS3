supersonic boom of wing-body configurations .  the supersonic boom in steady, level flight of a wing-bodyconfiguration is due to the effects of body volume, wing volume,wing incidence or lift, and wing-body interference .  thecontribution in the far field of each of these factors can, in any givenazimuthal plane, be represented as that of an equivalent bodyof revolution .  this concept is developed to investigate thepossibilities of using interference among the components of awing-body configuration to reduce or suppress the boom due tolift .  results of wind tunnel experiments are also presented anddiscussed in light of the theoretical indications .
