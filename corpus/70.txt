a study of flow changes associated with airfoil sectiondrag rise at supercritical speeds .  a study of experimental pressure distributions and sectioncharacteristics for several moderately thick airfoil sections was made .  acorrelation appears to exist between the drag-divergence mach numberand the free-stream mach number for which sonic velocity occurs at theairfoil crest, the chordwise station at which the airfoil surface istangent to the free-stream direction .  it was found that, since themach number for which sonic velocity occurs at the airfoil crest can beestimated satisfactorily by means of the prandtl-glauert rule, a methodis provided whereby the drag-divergence mach number of an airfoilsection at a given angle of attack can be estimated from the low-speedpressure distribution and the airfoil profile .  this method was usedto predict with a reasonable degree of accuracy the drag-divergencemach number of a considerable number of airfoil sections having diverseshapes and a wide range of thickness-chord ratios .  the pressure distributions and section force characteristics ofseveral moderately thick airfoil sections at mach numbers above thedrag-divergence mach number were analyzed .  some of the characteristicsof the flow over these airfoils at supercritical mach numbers arediscussed .
