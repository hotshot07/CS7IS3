calculated velocity distributions and force derivativesfor a series of high-speed aerofoils .  the polygon method of woods is used tocalculate the velocity distribution over a number oftwo-dimensional aerofoils at low incidence, subcritical flows onlybeing considered .  lift slopes and aerodynamic centresat zero lift are also calculated .  some comparisons with experimental results are made, andthese show good agreement at zero incidence .
