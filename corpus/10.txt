Text: the theory of the impact tube at low pressure .  a theoretical analysis has been made for an impact tube of therelation between free-stream mach number and the impact andfree-stream pressures and densities for extremely low pressures .it is shown that the results differ appreciably from thecorresponding continuum relations .
