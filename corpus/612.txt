Text: pressure distributions and flow patterns at m=4 . onsome delta wings of inverted 'v' cross section .  wind tunnel tests have been madeto measure pressure distributionsand to study flow patterns on a seriesof delta wings of inverted 'v'cross-section .  each of these wingswas designed to have a plane shockwave in the plane of the leading edgesat a chosen mach number and incidence .  it was found that for a wideincidence range about the design pointthe shock wave remained virtuallyattached to the leading edges and ateach incidence the pressure wasapproximately constant over the lowersurface .
