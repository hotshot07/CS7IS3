the flexural vibrations of thin cylinders .the flexural vibrations of the walls of thin cylinders are considered .in this type of vibration many forms of nodal pattern may exist owing tothe combination of circumferential and axial nodes .  theoreticalexpressions are developed for the natural frequencies of cylinders withfreely-supported and fixed ends and a comparison is made with thefrequencies obtained experimentally .  in practice, the ends of cylinders are subjected to a certain degreeof fixing by end-plates, flanges, etc., and the natural frequencies thuslie between the corresponding values for freely-supported and fixedends .  to make possible the estimation of such frequencies, a method isdevised in which an equivalent wavelength factor is used .  this factorrepresents the wavelength of the freely-supported cylinder that wouldhave the same frequency as the cylinder under consideration whenvibrating in the same mode .  the results of experimental investigationswith various end thicknesses and flange dimensions are recorded, andfrom these the equivalent factors are derived .  sets of curves calculated for cylinders with freely-supported ends andcovering a range of cylinder thicknesses are given .  from these it ispossible to obtain close approximation to the frequencies of cylindersunder other end conditions by the use of an appropriate factor .  anexample is given of frequency calculations for a large air-receiver forwhich two frequencies were identified by experiment .
