theoretical prediction of the transonic characteristicsof airfoils .  it is shown that the author's transonic-flow airfoil theorycan be used to estimate transonic drag-rise and onset-of-separation-effects mach numbers without reference to experimentalresults .  a simple comparative method is applied to a series ofairfoils, and the results are analyzed to determine some of thedesign features of importance in transonic flow .  animprovement to this scheme is shown to give results in good agreementwith experiment for both the first appearance of shock wavesand the onset of separation effects .  application to finite sweptwings is briefly considered and illustrated .
