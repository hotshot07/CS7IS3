investigation of local heat transfer and pressure dragcharacteristics of a yawed circular cylinder at supersonicspeeds .  local heat-transfer coefficients,temperature recovery factors, andpressure distributions were measuredon a circular cylinder at a nominalmach number of 3.9 over a range offree-stream reynolds numbers fromfrom 0 to 44 .  it was found that yawing thecylinder reduced the local heat-transfercoefficients, the average heat-transfercoefficients, and the pressuredrag coefficients over the front sideof the cylinder .  for example, atis reduced by 34 percent and thepressure drag by 60 percent .  theamount of reduction may be predicted bya theory presented herein .  localtemperature recovery factors were alsoreduced by yaw, but the amount ofreduction is small compared to thereduction in heat-transfer coefficients .  a comparison of these data withother data obtained under widelydifferent conditions of body and streamtemperature, mach number, andreynolds number indicates that thesefactors have little effect upon thedropoff of heat transfer due to yaw .
