Text: panel flutter tests on full scale x-15 lower verticalstabilizer at mach number of 3. 0.  panel flutter tests were conductedon two full-scale verticalstabilizers of the x-15 airplane at amach number of 3.0 in the langleyat dynamic pressures from 1,500 psfto 5,000 psf and stagnation temperaturesfrom 300 f to 660 f .  flutterboundaries were obtained for four ofthe five distinct types of panelswhich make up the vertical sides ofthe stabilizers .  the boundariesconsisted of a flat-panel boundaryand a thermally buckled-panelboundary .  the flat-panel boundaries werecharacterized by a reduction indynamic pressure with increasing skintemperature,. whereas, after thermalbuckling the trend was reversed .  theminimum dynamic pressure forflutter occurred at the intersection ofthe flat-panel and buckled-panelboundaries and represented a largereduction in the dynamic pressureover the extrapolated, unstressed value .as a result of panel flutter,three of the five distinct types ofpanels were modified to provide therequired flutter margin on the designflight dynamic pressure of theaircraft .
