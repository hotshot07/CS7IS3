Text: local circumferential buckling of thin circular cylindricalshells .  the problem of circumferentialbuckling of a thin circularcylindrical shell due to compressivehoop stresses which vary in the axialdirection is examined .  forextremely localised compressive hoop stressdistributions resulting fromthermal discontinuity effects, or from auniform, radial line loading,the buckle pattern should also belocalised .  simplified analysesinto these two types of problem areconsidered which show that onlya limited number of buckle deflectionmodes needs to be assumed .
