minimum wing wave drag with volume constraint .  a numerical method is developed for calculating the minimumthickness drag for a given wing planform and volume usinglinearized supersonic flow theory .  the corresponding optimumvolume distribution is also determined .  the results show thatconsiderable drag reduction is possible by improved volumedistribution .
