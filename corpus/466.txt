Text: development of the vapour screen method of flowvisualization in the 3ft tunnel at rae bedford.  the vapour screen method of flow visualisation in supersonic windtunnels is outlined, and the development of a suitable technique for usein the 3 ft tunnel described, together with the associated optical andphotographic equipment .  the results of tests to determine the humidity required to produce anoptimum density of fog in the working section over the mach number rangetemperature discussed .  numerous vapour screen photographs of the flowover and behind delta wings are included and some comparisons made withthe corresponding surface oil-flow patterns .  the process of condensation, the physical and optical properties ofthe resulting fog, and the formation of the vapour screen picture areall considered in some detail .  the effects of humidity on the mach number and static pressure in theworking section were investigated and the results are compared withtheoretical estimates at a nominal mach number of 2.0 .  it is shownthat the adverse effects of condensation on the flow at high machnumbers may be alleviated by the use of liquids with a lower latent heatof evaporation than water, and some results obtained at a mach number of  the possibility of extending the vapour screen technique to transonicand subsonic speeds is also considered, and some results obtained at amach number of 0.85 are included .
