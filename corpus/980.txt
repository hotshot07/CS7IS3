a method of computing the transient temperature of thick walls fromarbitrary variation of adiabatic-wall temperature and heat-transfercoefficient .a method of calculating the temperature of thick walls has beendeveloped in which are used relatively new concepts, such as the timeseries and the response to a unit triangle variation of surfacetemperature, together with essentially standard formulas for transienttemperature and heat flow into thick walls . the method can be usedwithout knowledge of the mathematical tools of its development . themethod is particularly suitable for determining the wall temperature inone-dimensional thermal problems in aeronautics where there is acontinuous variation of the heat-transfer coefficient and adiabatic-walltemperature . the method also offers a convenient means for solving theinverse problem of determining the heat-flow history when temperaturehistory is known .a series of diversified problems were solved by exact analysis as wellas by the new method . a comparison of the results shows the newmethod to be accurate . the labor involved is very modest inconsideration of the nature of the thick-wall temperature problem .limiting solutions for the /infinitely thick/ wall and for walls sothin that thermal lag can be neglected were also obtained .
