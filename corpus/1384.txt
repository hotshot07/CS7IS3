Text: a theoretical calculation of the laminar boundary layeraround an elliptic cylinder and its comparison withexperiment .the author, in conjunction with th. von karman,has recently given a new method of approximateintegration of the prandtl boundary layer equations,which was developed in order to treat cases in whichseparation of a laminar boundary layer might beexpected .  the method was developed because some doubtwas felt as to the accuracy with which the well-knownpohlhausen analysis would describe conditions in theneighborhood of such a separation point .  numericalcalculations were carried out for certain cases involvingtheoretical simplifications, and very considerablediscrepancies were found between the results of the newand pohlhausen methods .  the method was also usedin developing a theory for the maximum lift coefficientof certain classes of airfoils .  this theory gavesatisfactory agreement with experiment but no directexperimental check on the boundary layer analysis itself hasbeen given up to the present .
