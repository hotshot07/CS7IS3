Text: measurements at mach numbers up to 2. 8 of the longitudinalcharacteristics of one plane and three cambered slender'ogee' wings .  measurements have been made ofthe longitudinal characteristics of oneplane and three cambered slender ogeewings (p = 0.45,) at twosubsonic and eight supersonic machnumbers up to 2.8 .  the tests also includedmeasurements of the zero-lift pressuredrag and support interference of theplane wing .  the results have been analysedto give data for estimating theperformance of supersonic transport aircraft .
