Text: natural frequencies of rectangular plates with edgeselastically restrained against rotation .  plates with attachments to heavier members along theedges can be described as having edges elastically restrainedagainst rotation, in many cases uniformly along each edge .  atthe edges, setting slope, when is the edge bendingmoment with always positive, the elastic restraint can beanalytically defined with describing respectively,clamped and simply supported edges .  in this note naturalfrequencies of such plates are calculated mainly following thenomenclature of dana young .
