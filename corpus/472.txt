Text: waves in supersonic flow .in this chapter we shall mainly consider problems of steady, two-dimensional (plane) supersonic flow .  using the fact that in this casethere is a steady wave system, we shall find solutions by an indirectapproach .  that is, we shall first study the conditions under whichsimple stationary waves may exist in the flow, and then find the flowboundaries to which they correspond or which may be fitted tothem .  in this procedure the limited upstream influence in a supersonicfield is very helpful, for it allows flows to be analyzed orconstructed step by step, which is a method that is not possible inthe subsonic case .
