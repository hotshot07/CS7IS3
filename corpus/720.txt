Text: a note on the use of sandwich structures in severe acousticenvironments .this paper reviews some of the experience to date of using sandwich typestructures in severe acoustic pressure environments .  the methodsused for testing sandwich structures for acoustic fatigue are describedand their limitations considered .  experimental and theoretical workrelating to the damping and mode-frequency relationships of certainsandwich configurations is also reviewed .special attention is given to the estimation of the stress in the bondof a honeycomb sandwich panel subjected to sudden pressurefluctuations .  a /uni-modal/ theory is presented, relating themean-square bond-stress to the random exciting pressure and panel dynamiccharacteristics .  this theory indicates that tensile bond stressesmay be encountered of up to six times the local r.m.s. excitingpressure .  these must be combined with bending and shear stressesto obtain the principal stresses which precipitate bond fatiguefailures .finally, an outline is given of some of the lines of future researchwhich should lead to the achieving of the maximum possible fatigueresistance from sandwich configurations .
