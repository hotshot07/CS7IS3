Text: a theory of imperfection for the vibrations of elastic bodies ofrevolution .various observations and preliminary experimentshave shown that the effect of imperfections upon thevibrations of bodies of revolution cannot be neglected .owing to the possibility of applying the lagrangeequation, the influence of the imperfections could betraced through the kinetic energy, the potential energyand the dissipation function .  although the fundamentaldifficulty of the uncertainty of certain variableswas not eliminated, this procedure permitted at leastthe making of general qualitative statements as to thebehaviour of the system if imperfections are present .
