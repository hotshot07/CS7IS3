Text: procedure for calculating flutter at high supersonicspeed including camber deflections, and comparisonwith experimental results .  a method which may be used at high supersonic mach numbers isdescribed for calculating the flutter speed of wings having camber intheir deflection modes .  the normal coupled vibration modes of the wingare used to derive the equations of motion .  chord deflections of thevibration modes are approximated by polynomials .  the wing may have acontrol surface and may carry external stores although no aerodynamicforces on the stores are presented .  the aerodynamic forces that areassumed to be acting on the wing are obtained from piston theory andalso from a quasi-steady form of a theory for two-dimensional steadyflow .  airfoil shape and thickness effects are taken account of in theanalysis .  the method is used to calculate the flutter speed of some wingswhich had been previously tested at mach numbers of 1.3 to 3.0 .comparison of the calculations and experiment is made for flat-plate 60and 45 delta wings and also for an untapered 45 sweptback wing .
