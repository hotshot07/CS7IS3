Text: scale models for thermo-aeroelastic research .  an investigation is made of theparameters to be satisfied forthermo-aeroelastic similarity .  it is concludedthat complete similarity obtainsonly when aircraft and model are identicalin all respects, including size .  by limiting consideration toconduction effects, by assuming the majorload carrying parts of the structureare in regions where the flow is eitherentirely laminar, or entirely turbulent,and by assuming a specificrelationship between reynolds number and nusseltnumber, an approach to similarity canbe achieved for small scale models .experimental and analytical work isrequired to check on the validity of these assumptions .  it appears that existing hot windtunnels will not be completelyadequate for thermo-aeroelastic work, andaccordingly a possible layout forthe type of tunnel required is described .automatic programmed control ofthe tunnel would appear to be necessary .
