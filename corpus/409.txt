Text: on the base pressure resulting from the interaction of a supersonicexternal stream with a sonic or subsonic jet .it is shown that the two-dimensional base pressure problems relating tobase bleed into the wake of blunt-trailing-edge airfoils, or theinteraction between an external supersonic or sonic slipstream with asonic or subsonic jet stream of a jet engine, can be calculated bytheoretical considerations . constant-pressure, isoenergetic, turbulentmixing between the streams and the stagnant fluid in the wake isassumed . the theoretical calculations are in good agreement with theexperimental results .
