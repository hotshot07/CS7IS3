equilibrium real-gas performance charts for a shypersonicshock-tube wind-tunnel employing nitrogen .  charts are presented coveringa wide range of reflected-shockwind-tunnel operating conditions, usingnitrogen as the working gas .  astatistical-mechanical model of the gasis assumed which takes account ofmolecular vibration, electronic excitationand dissociation .  the gas isassumed to be constantly inequilibrium that is, the reaction rates aretaken to be infinitely fast .  the equationsof motion are solved with theaid of a digital computer, previously reportedresults for the state of theshock-processed gas in the shock-tube being used .
