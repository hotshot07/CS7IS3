Text: the pressure gradient induced by shear flow past aflat plate .  article is a continuation of an earlier note on papers by lion a semiinfinite plate in a uniform shear flow .  li had deducedfrom the form of his equations that stream vorticity caused aninduced pressure gradient in the flow .  later papers by li andmurray (amr 15(1962), rev. 7157) support the induced pressuregradient theory .  the author notes, however, that the mathematics usedby li and murray are not acceptable and the problem thus notresolved .  the present note sets up simple models of complete flowsexaminable by elementary means .  author holds that analysesdemonstrate conclusively that no pressure gradient is induced inthe boundary layer on a flat plate in a limited region of shear flow .he notes that the original question in the case of unbounded shearremains obscure--and anyway an unlimited shear layer is not ofgreat practical importance .
