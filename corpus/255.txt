Text: an approximate solution of the turbulent boundary layerequations in incompressible and compressible .  if over the 'outer region' of the boundary layer, where the meanvelocity varies but little from its value outside the shear layer, avirtual eddy viscosity is defined, which is constant over the outerregion but varies in the direction of the mainstream, a solution of theturbulent boundary layer equations can be found which satisfies theappropriate boundary conditions .  the solution leads to a compatibilitycondition for the virtual eddy viscosity in terms of the wall shearstress, the boundary layer momentum thickness and the mainstreamvelocity, at least for the case of a constant external velocity .  thiscompatibility condition, which can be expressed asfor moderate to high reynolds numbers, where is the shear velocity,is the boundary layer thickness and is the virtual eddy (kinematic)viscosity, is just the condition townsend (1956) found for theequilibrium of the large eddies .  the numerical value of the constantderived by townsend agrees with ours for reynolds numbers (based on x)of about .  with this relation for an equation, analoguous to themomentum integral equation solution, can be found for as a function oflocal freestream velocity, with one disposable parameter .
