application of similar solutions to calculations oflaminar heat transfer on bodies with yaw and largepressure gradients in high speed flow .  an integral method for the rapid calculation of heat-transferdistributions on yawed cylinders of arbitrary cross-sectional shapeand on bodies of revolution in high-speed flows is developed forlaminar boundary layers .  the method involves the quadrature of afunction of the pressure distribution (assumed given) and satisfiesthe integral energy equation with the assumption of local similarity,wherein the actual boundary-layer profiles at every station arereplaced by corresponding profiles from a family of similar solutions .  the method is compared with other local similarity methods andwith experimental heat-transfer data on a circular cylinder and on abody of revolution designed for large axial pressure gradients .  goodagreement between theory and data is obtained and it is shown that thepresent integral method, in both its complete and simplified form, givesgenerally better agreement with the data than certain other localsimilarity methods .  numerical examples are presented showing that the effect of sweepand gas properties on heat-transfer distribution is small .
