measurements of stagnation point heat transfer at lowreynolds number .  measurements of stagnation point heat transfer are presentedin the reynolds number range between the free molecular flowand the range where modified boundary layer theory still applies .the measurements are compared with the analytical methodsset forth by ferri, zakkay, and ting .  the results show smoothtransition between the two regions and indicate that thepredicted reynolds number for which the modified boundary layertheory can be used is in agreement with experiments .  in thelower range of reynolds number the ratio ofdecreases and reaches a value of 1 at a reynolds number of 40 .
