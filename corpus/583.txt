Text: influence coefficients for real gases .in the analysis of one-dimensional fluid-flow problems, it is oftenassumed that the behavior of the medium is that of a perfect gas .this assumption is justified, provided the pressure and temperaturerange of interest is small and near atmospheric .  at higher pressuresand temperatures various deviations are introduced thereby causingdeviations from the results obtained by using the ideal fluid-flowequations .in this note, influence coefficients, similar to those developed byshapiro, are presented for the case of real gases .  this analysis isbased upon the use of various functions of the compressibility factoremmons .  some of the assumptions made were as follows..  (1) the flowis one-dimensional and steady, (2) changes in the stream propertiesare continuous, and (3) the flow is comprised of imperfect gases
