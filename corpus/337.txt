Text: boundary layer transition with gas injection .the mass-injection process has been proposed as a methodof cooling aerodynamic surfaces, and, since the amount ofcoolant required to maintain practical wall temperatures isconsiderably larger for turbulent than for laminar boundary layers,knowledge of the effect of the cooling method on the transitionprocess is certainly important .  exploratory studies reportedhere were conducted at mach number 3.7 to ascertain theeffects of gas injection on the stability of the laminar boundarylayer on a conical surface .
