heat transfer to separated and reattached subsonicturbulen flows obtained downstream of a surface step .  local heat-transfer coefficients and recovery factors arepresented for separated and reattached turbulent flows as obtainedby a downward step in an otherwise flat surface in a two-dimensional, subsonic, air flow .  the region downstream of the step,the focus of this investigation, contained a region of separatedflow with reattachment at about five step heights downstream,followed by a section of reattached flow .  the salient feature ofthe results is the maximum in the local heat-transfer coefficientat the reattachment point, with values thereof diminishing in theseparated region and also in the reattached region, where theytend toward values characteristic of turbulent boundary-layerflow .  it is found that for most of the region the heat-transfercoefficient depends on the velocity to about the 0.8 power, thougha decreased dependence may exist in the separated region .recovery factors have the characteristically low values associatedwith separated flows, and do not attain values typical ofturbulent boundary-layer flows within the downstream lengthsavailable .
