Text: asymptotic solutions of toroidal shell problems .  method of asymptotic integration developed by e. reissner andauthor is refined, and solutions previously obtained for problemsof bending of curved tube and of a toroidal expansion jointsubject to an axial force are generalized and extended .  results arecompared to those obtained by l. beskin .  for large values of acertain parameter, agreement is good .
