Text: upper and lower bounds for the solution of the firstbiharmonic boundary value problem .  let w(x,y) be a solution of the boundary value problemwhere r is a planedomain with the boundary c .  the authors obtain upper andlower bounds for, the value of w at a point in r,by a method which is applicable to many other problems .  if u is a function satisfying the boundary conditionsand v is a function satisfying the partial differentialequation, then the authors obtain by applying green'sclassical identity and schwarz's inequality a pair of inequalitiesof the form where .  together with the function w the authors consider afunction the solution of the boundary value problemon c, and inanalogy with the functions u and v associated with thefunction w a pair of functions and associated with thefunction .  in the expression for derived from green'sclassical identity appears an unknown line integralcontaining the values of w and on c .  but the same lineintegral appears also in the expressions forto which the above inequalities areapplicable .  in this way the authors obtain two inequalities of the formwhere b and b', respectively, are approximatevalues of .  in order to improve these boundsone may add to u a linear set of functions and to v alinear set of functions and then minimize h(u-v) in orderto determine the coefficients of the best linear combinations .if the sequences and are complete in a certain sensedefined by the authors the approximations will converge tothe value .
