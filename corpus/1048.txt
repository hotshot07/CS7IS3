Text: a small deflection theory for curved sandwich plates .  a small-deflection theory that takes into account deformationsdue to transverse shear is presented for the elastic-behavioranalysis of orthotropic plates of constant cylindrical curvaturewith considerations of buckling included .  the theory isapplicable primarily to sandwich construction .
