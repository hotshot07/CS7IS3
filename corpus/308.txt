Text: on the hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate withsuction or injection .  the hypersonic viscous flow past a flatplate with suction or injectionis dealt with by karman-pohlhausen'smethod in special cases whensuction or injection velocity proportionalto, especiallyfor the region of strong interaction betweenthe shock wave and theboundary layer, were p is the pressure onthe plate and x is thedistance measured along the plate from its leading edge .  several numerical examples are given,which shows similar effects ofinjection to those in the case of incompressibleflow that the injectionmakes all the height of the shock wave,the thickness of the boundarylayer and the pressure on the plate largerthan those in the case of noinjection .  on the contrary, in the case ofsuction no remarkable changeboth in the height of the shock wave andthe pressure on the plate canbe seen and only the velocity profile inthe boundary layer is affectedby the suction .
