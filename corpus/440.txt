compilation of information on the transonic attachmentof flows at the leading edge of airfoils .  schlieren photographs have been compiled of the two-dimensional flowat transonic speeds past 37 airfoils having variously shaped profiles,some of which are related and vary in thickness and camber .  the datafor these airfoils were analyzed to provide basic information on theflow changes involved and to determine factors affecting transonic-flowattachment, which is a transition from separated to unseparated flow atthe leading edges of two-dimensional airfoils at fixed angles of attackas the subsonic mach number is increased .
