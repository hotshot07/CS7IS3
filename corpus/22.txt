on slip-flow heat transfer to a flat plate .  assuming that continuum flow energy equation in a boundarylayer remains valid well into slip region and taking account of thetemperature jump in a moving rarefied gas and for influence oflarge mean free path through appropriate boundary conditions, asolution is found for the temperature gradient in the slip region .then from maslen expression (j. aero. sci. 25, 6, 400-401, juneslipping fluid to a flat plate, and behavior confirms results forsmall values of knudsen number .
