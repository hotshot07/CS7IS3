Text: determination of upper-atmosphere air density and scale height fromsatellite observations .a solution is obtained for the rate of change of semi-major axis andperigee distance of a satellite orbit with time due to the resistance of the atmosphere . the logarithm of air density is assumed to varyquadratically with height, and the oblateness of the atmosphere is takeninto account .the calculation of perigee air density in terms of the rate of changeof satellite period is dealt with,. and the method is applied to dataat present available on six different satellites . the variation of airdensity with height is obtained asin p-28.59/0.15/-h-200//46/5/0.028/0.013//h-200///46/for h in the range of approximately 170 to 700 km, where p is in grams/cm, h is in kilometres and standard deviations are given in brackets .
