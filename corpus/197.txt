Text: pressure distributions on three bodies of revolutionto determine the effect of reynolds number up to andincluding the transonic speed range .  this paper presents the results of an investigation conducted inthe langley 16-foot transonic tunnel to determine the effects of varyingreynolds number on the pressure distribution on a transonic body ofrevolution at angles of attack through the transonic speed range .  theeffect of a change in sting cone angle on the pressure distributionsand a comparison of experimental incremental pressures with theory isalso included .  the models were tested through a mach number range from 0.60 to 1.09 .the reynolds number range based on body length was from 9 x 10 to 39 xdiameter was 1.3 x 10 to 4.53 x 10 for the model at 8 angle of attack .  an increase in reynolds number from 9 x 10 to 39 x 10 affectedthe longitudinal pressure distributions very slightly .  these effectswere of such a nature as to cause an increase of 0.05 in thenormal-force coefficient of the body when tested in the subcritical cross-flowreynolds number range .  this increase is in agreement with theoreticalapproximations .  a comparison between experimental and theoretical values of theincremental pressure coefficient due to angle of attack indicated goodagreement except at angles where separated flow areas existed over thebody .  the effect of a change in sting-cone angle from 5 to 9 on thepressure distribution of the 120-inch model was negligible up to amach number of 1.05 .  at this mach number the effect was to cause asmall increase in the velocity over the rear of the body .
