the boundary layer on a flat plate in a stream withuniform shear .the incompressible laminar boundary layeron a semi-infinite flat plate isconsidered, when the main stream has uniformshear .  a solution is obtained forthe first two terms of an asymptotic solutionfor small viscosity .  it is shown thatone of the principal effects of free-streamvorticity is to introduce a modifiedpressure field outside the boundary-layer region .
