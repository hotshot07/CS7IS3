advantages and limitations of models .summary ..  the use of models for structural test investigations in thepresence of kinetic heating effects is examined .  the principalfeatures of the complex process to berepresented are discussed under the classificationsexternal air flow, internal heat transfer,elastic response .  of these the second is foundto influence most model design, and ananalysis of a typical structure is included toillustrate the various contributions tointernal heat transfer .
