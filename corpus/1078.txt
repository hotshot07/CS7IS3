the steady flow of a viscous fluid past a circular cylinder at reynoldsnumbers 40 and 44 .this paper describes the numerical solution of the completenavier-stokes equations for the steady flow of an incompressible viscous fluidof unlimited extent past a circular cylinder at reynolds number 40 . anew device developed for the numerical solution is described . theresults of the investigation are ..good agreement with experimental results .higher reynolds numbers even though they may not exist in nature . asolution has been obtained at reynolds number 44 but it has not beencarried to the same accuracy as the solution at reynolds number 40 .portion of the cylinder continues to increase with reynolds number insuch steady-state solutions up to a reynolds number 44 and no indication has been found that this process will not continue as the reynoldsnumber is increased beyond 44 .
