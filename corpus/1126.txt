Text: an engineer's conceptual approach to the buckling ofcylindrical shell (axial loading) .by using the well known analogy betweenthe bending of a beam on an elasticfoundation and the axial symmetricdisplacement of a cylinder, a physicalinsight is obtained for the buckling ofcylindrical shells under axialcompression .  the technique is equivalentto classical small deflection theoryand provides good agreement with the moreelaborate solutions for the bucklingstrength of various sandwich, multi-layered,and orthotropic cylinders,including the effects of internal pressureor an elastic core .
