Text: quasi-cylindrical surfaces with prescribed loadingsin the linearised theory of supersonic flow .  a formula for the velocity field in terms of a given surfacedistribution of vorticity is applied to pointslying on the surface .  an equationgiving the shape of a quasicircular-cylindrical surface in terms of aprescribed loading is derived .  as anexample a half ring wing with prescribedloading is discussed .
