investigation at supersonic speeds of the effects ofjet mach number and divergence angle of the nozzleupon the pressure of the base annulus of a body ofrevolution .  an investigation has been conductedin the langley 9-inch supersonictunnel to determine the jet effects forvarying jet mach number andnozzle divergence angle upon the pressureon the base annulus of a model witha cylindrical afterbody .  the testswere conducted over a wide range ofjet static pressure ratios and at areynolds number of approximatelyfree-stream mach numbers of 1.62, 1.94,and 2.41 .  all testing was conductedwith an artificially inducedturbulent boundary layer along the model .  in the lower range of jet staticpressure ratios, jet flow from asonic or supersonic nozzle affectedthe pressure acting on the baseannulus in essentially the same manneras shown in naca rm e53h25 which coversjet static pressure ratios up to aboutpresent results showed that the basepressure tends to level off withincreasing jet static pressure ratio,and at the extreme static pressureratios reached in tests with sonicnozzles the base pressure began todecrease .  except in the lower rangeof jet static pressure ratios,nozzle divergence angle generally had alarger effect on the base pressuresthan nozzle mach number,. the increasein base pressure for a change indivergence angle from 0 to 10 wassmall compared to the increase whenthe divergence angle was changed fromand other data indicates that the effectsof divergence angle were reducedwhen the ratio of jet exit diameter to basediameter was decreased .  jetmach number effects increased with increase in stream mach number .
