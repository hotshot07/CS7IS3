Text: test of an aerodynamically heated multi-- web wingstructure (mw-1) in a free jet at mach number 2.  a multiweb wing structure, representing an airplane or missile wing,was tested under simulated supersonic flight conditions to determine thetransient temperature distribution .  the aerodynamic loads played animportant and unanticipated role, however, in that the model experienceda dynamic failure near the end of the test .  the test is discussed andthe conclusion reached that the model failed as a result of the combinedaction of aerodynamic heating and loading .  the temperature datacollected are analyzed and are shown to be in reasonable agreement withcalculated values .
