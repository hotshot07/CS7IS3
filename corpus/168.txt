Text: heat conduction through a gas with one inert internalmodel .  the rate of energy transfer betweenparallel flat plates is evaluatedwhen the (stagnant) gas between them ispolyatomic with one inert internalmode .  deviations of the thermalconductivity from the complete equilibriumof the inert mode relaxation timeand the effectiveness of the walls inexciting or de-exciting this mode .the results are obtained via a lineartheory consistent with smalltemperature differences between the plates .  it is found that the eucken-valueof conductivity could be exceededif the relaxation times are non-zero andthe plates very effective inexciting the inert mode .  when relaxationtimes are very short the effectof the walls on the energy transfer rateis small, but the walls maketheir presence felt by distorting thetemperature profiles in /boundarylayers/ adjacent to the walls which areof order in thicknesstime) .  this result isanalogous to hirschfelder's (1956) for thecase of chemical reactions .  for experimental measurement ofconductivity in a hot wire cell typeof apparatus it is shown that extrapolationof measured reciprocalconductivities to zero reciprocal pressureshould load to the full euckenvalue .  it is also shown that the slope ofreciprocal apparent (measured)conductivity versus reciprocal pressurecurves is a function of relaxationtime as well as of the accommodationcoefficients .  it is quite possiblethat the relaxation effect here iscomparable with the temperature jumpeffects, even for rotation in diatomic molecules .
