a theoretical analysis of heat transfer in regions of separated flow .    the flow field analyzed consists of a thin, constant pressureviscous mixing layer separated from a solid surface by an enclosedregion of low-velocity air (/dead air/) . the law of conservation ofenergy is employed to relate calculated conditions within theseparated mixing layer to the rate of heat transfer at the solidsurface . this physical speed is app ied to alminar separations incompressible flow for various prandtl numbers, including considerationof the case where air is injected into the separated region  .
