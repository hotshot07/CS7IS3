Text: viscous compressible and incompressible flow in slenderchannels .  an analytical study is made of viscous flow in slenderchannels .  similar solutions to the approximate equations of motion,valid for flow at moderate or high reynolds numbers in slenderchannels, are found for incompressible two-dimensional andaxisymmetric flows and for compressible flows throughtwo-dimensional channels with adiabatic walls .  a study ofcompressible flows in convergent-divergent channels yields resultsregarding the effect of viscosity on the location of the sonic line,on the pressure ratio at the geometric throat and on the dischargecoefficient for such channels .
