ground measurements of airplane shock wave noise atmach numbers to 2, and at altitudes of 60,000 feet .  the intensity of shock-wave noise at the ground resulting fromflights at mach numbers to 2.0 and altitudes to 60,000 feet wasmeasured .  measurements near the ground track for flights of asupersonic fighter and one flight of a supersonic bomber arepresented .  level cruising flight at an altitude of 60,000 feet and a machnumber of 2.0 produced sonic booms which were considered to betolerable, and it is reasonable to expect that cruising flight at higheraltitudes will produce booms of tolerable intensity for airplanes of thesize and weight of the test airplanes .  the measured variation ofsonic-boom intensity with altitude was in good agreement with thevariation calculated by an equation given in nasa technical note d-48 .  the effect of mach number on the ground overpressure is small betweenmach numbers of 1.4 and 2.0, a result in agreement with the theory .  noamplification of the shock-wave overpressures due to refraction effectswas apparent near the cutoff mach number .  a method for estimating the effect of flight-path angle on cutoffmach number is shown .  experimental results indicate agreement with themethod, since a climb maneuver produced booms of a much decreasedintensity as compared with the intensity of those measured in level flight atabout the same altitude and mach number .  comparison of sound pressure levels for the fighter and bomberairplanes indicated little effect of either airplane size or weight at analtitude of 40,000 feet .
