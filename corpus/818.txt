Text: a quantitative comparison of flow and deformation theoriesof plasticity .  the stresses and displacements in a partly plastic,infinitely long, hollow cylinder are obtained according to theflow type of stress-strain law of prandtl-reuss and to thedeformation law of hencky .  in both cases the mises yieldcondition is used and the compressibility of the material istaken into account .  it is shown that under theseassumptions the two theories yield substantially the sameresults for this particular problem, but that one theory orthe other may be preferable for computing purposes incertain cases .  the results are compared with those ofother investigations in which different combinations ofstress-strain law, yield condition, compressibility, and endloading were assumed .
