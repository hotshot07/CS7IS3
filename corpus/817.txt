Text: loading paths and the incremental stress law .  this paper will be concerned with some properties of thestress-strain law for work hardening materials introduced by w. pragerincremental strain or plastic flow law by which it is meant that thedifferentials of strain are expressed as functions of the stresses,strains, and differentials of the stress .  we shall also have occasionto refer to total strain or plastic deformation laws, in which thestrains are given directly as functions of the stress .
