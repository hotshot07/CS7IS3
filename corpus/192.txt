on the hypersonic viscous flow past slender bodiesof revolution .  a similar solution of the hypersonic viscous flow past slender bodiesof revolution is deduced for a special case when the radial coordinateof the body surface at section x is proportional to x, where the radialcoordinate have the comparable order value with the thickness of theboundary layer .  here, /similar/ is used in the direct meaning thatdistributions in the boundary layer keep the similar form lengthwise .calculations are accomplished for the region of strong interactionbetween the boundary layer and the shock wave .  from several calculationsit may be expected that if the thickness of the body becomes small, thethickness of the layer in which the longitudinal velocity component u israpidly decreased also becomes small, and in the major part of theboundary layer, only the normal component v is increased .  further ifthe thickness of the body is increased, then, the height of the shockwave, the pressure on the wall, and the shear stress at the wall arealso increased while the boundary layer thickness is decreased .  thenose region is excluded by the reason that the ordinary boundary layertheory will be invalid there .
