Text: an analysis of the applicability of the hypersonicsimilarity law to the study of the flow about bodiesof revolution at zero angle of attack .  the hypersonic similarity law as derived by tsien has beeninvestigated by comparing the pressure distributions along bodies ofrevolution at zero angle of attack .  in makingthese comparisons, particularattention was given to determining the limits of mach number and finenessratio for which the similarity law applies .  for the purpose of thisinvestigation, pressure distributionsdetermined by the method ofcharacteristics for ogive cylinders forvalues of mach numbers and finenessratios varying from 1.5 to 12 were compared .pressures on various conesand on cone cylinders were also compared in this study .  the pressure distributions presented demonstrate that the hypersonicsimilarity law is applicable over awider range of values of mach numbersand fineness ratios than might be expected from the assumptions made inthe derivation .  this is significant since within the range ofapplicability of the law a single pressuredistribution exists for all similarlyshaped bodies for which the ratio offree-stream mach number to finenessratio is constant .  charts are presentedfor rapid determination ofpressure distributions over ogive cylinders for any combination of machnumber and fineness ratio within defined limits .
