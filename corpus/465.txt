slender delta wings with sharp edges at zero lift .  several slender wings of delta planform with sharp edges have beeninvestigated theoretically at zero lift at subsonic and at supersonicspeeds .  most of the wings have diamond-shaped cross sections and areintended to lead to a type of flow with leading-edge separation in thelifting condition .  the pressure distributions and overallnormal-pressure drags resulting from various theoretical methods are comparedwith one another and some discussion is included concerning thepossibility of achieving the results, calculated for an inviscid stream,in a real flow in the presence of a viscous layer around the body .
