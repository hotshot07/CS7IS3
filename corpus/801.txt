experimental study of the equivalence of transonicflow about slender cone-cylinders of circular and ellipticcross section .  this report describes an experimental investigation of the equivalencerelationship and the related theory for lifting forces proposed bytransonic slender-body theory .  the models chosen for this study are aflat, winglike, elliptic cone-cylinder and its equivalent body ofrevolution, a circular cone-cylinder .  it is determined that the flowsabout the two models are closely related in the manner predicted by thetheory, the relationship persisting over a mach number range of 0.92 tocone-cylinder vary linearly only over the small angle-of-attack range ofapproximately 1 and that the aerodynamic loading at sonic speed comparesfavorably with jones' slender-wing theory .  the results of the investigation suggest that at transonic speeds andat small angles of attack the calculation of all aerodynamiccharacteristics of slender, three-dimensional shapes can be made by useof transonic slender-body theory when the pressures on the equivalentbody of revolution are known, either by experiment, or by an adequatenonlinear theory .  from transonic slender-body theory it is deducedthat the slenderness required for this application is the same as thatrequired for the successful application of the transonic area rule .
