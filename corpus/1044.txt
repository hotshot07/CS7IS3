Text: on the theory of thin elastic shells .  general equations for the symmetrical finite deflection ofa rotationally symmetric thin shell are first obtained .  forsmall deflections these equations are reduced to a pair ofequations for the change of slope of the shell surface andthe product of the undeformed radius of the shell to theradial stress .  this choice of dependent variable is shown tobe advantageous .  two cases of shallow shells giveparticularly simple solutions ..  parabolic shells of nth degree anduniform thickness, and parabolic shells of mth degree withthickness varying as mth power of the distance from theapex .  for the first case, the solutions can be expressed interms of cylinder functions,. for the second, in powers ofthe paper concludes with a discussion of the asymptoticsolutions for small thickness .
