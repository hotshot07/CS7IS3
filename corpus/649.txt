the hovercraft - a new concept in maritime transport .  the hovercraft is the first operational britishproject in the ground-effect machine field .although there has, for a number of years, beena tentative searching after the principlesunderlying such machines, it is only now that theirpossibilities as commercial transport andservice craft are beginning to be developed .  since the hovercraft is a new vehicle, the appearanceof the saunders-roe sr-n1, a mannedexperimental craft, excited considerable public attentionand there have been a number ofdescriptive articles in the press .  papers of a moretechnical type, on ground-effect machines,are now beginning to appear and it is to be expectedthat these will rapidly increase in number,especially since american interest in both the commercialand defence fields is expanding fast .  the authors of the present paper have, therefore,concentrated attention upon featuresabout which they had something personal to say, andwhich they consider to be of particularsignificance for assessing the possibility of thehovercraft becoming important in maritimetransport .  these featuresare ..-    the hovercraft as a fundamentally new      principle in the transport field .    the powering requirements and resistance      characteristics .    the likely operating costs of hovercraft      in comparison with other forms of maritime transport .in addition, relatively brief descriptions ofthe history and the current work being undertakenon the ground-effect machine and of the design,construction, and testing of the saunders-roesr-n1 are provided .  the final section discussesoutstanding problems and some futurepossibilities .
