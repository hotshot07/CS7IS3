Text: intensity, scale and spectra of turbulence in mixingregion of free subsonic jet .  the intensity of turbulence, the longitudinal and lateralcorrelation coefficients, and the spectra of turbulence in a 3.5inch-diameter free jet were measured with hot-wire anemometers atexit mach numbers from 0.2 to 0.7 and reynolds numbers from  the results of these measurements show the following ..  (1)near the nozzle (distances less than 4 or 5 jet diam downstreamof the nozzle) the intensity of turbulence, expressed as percentof core velocity, is a maximum at a distance of approximatelyincreasing mach and or reynolds number .  at distances greaterthan 8 jet diameters downstream of the nozzle, however, themaximum intensity moves out and decreases in magnitude untilthe turbulence-intensity profiles are quite flat and approachingsimilarity .  (2) the lateral and longitudinal scales ofturbulence are nearly independent of mach and or reynolds numberand in the mixing zone near the jet vary proportionally withdistance from the jet nozzle .  (3) farther downstream of thejet the longitudinal scale reaches a maximum and then decreasesapproximately linearly with distance .  (4) near the nozzle thelateral scale is much smaller than the longitudinal and does notvary with distance from the centerline, while the longitudinalscale is a maximum at a distance from the centerline of aboutmum moves out from the centerline .  (6) a statistical analysisof the correlograms and spectra yields a /scale/ which, althoughdifferent in magnitude from the conventional, varies similarlyto the ordinary scale and is easier to evaluate .
