lower buckling load in the non-linear buckling theoryof thin shells .  for thin shells the relation betweenthe load p and the deflection beyond theclassical buckling load is very oftennon-linear .  for instance, when a uniform thincircular cylinder is loaded in the axialdirection, the load p when plotted against theend-shortening has the characteristicshown in fig. 1 .  if the strain energy s and thetotal potential are calculated,their behavior can be represented by thecurves shown in figs. 2 and 3 .  it can bedemonstrated that the branches oc and abcorresponds to stable equilibrium configurationsand the branch bc to unstableequilibrium configurations .  the point b is thenthe point of transition from stable tounstable equilibrium configurations .
