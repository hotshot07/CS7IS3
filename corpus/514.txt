Text: pressure distributions and flow patterns on some conicalshapes with sharp edges and symmetrical cross-sectionsat m=4 .0.  results are given of a wind tunnel programme made to study thepressure distributions and flow patterns over a series of simple,conical shapes at a mach number of 4.0 .  the results have been comparedwith various approximate theories and the limitations of these theoriesare discussed .  it is found that at this mach number leading edge separations stillhave an influence on the suction surface pressure, and that this surfacestill makes a significant contribution to the overall forces .
