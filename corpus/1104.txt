Text: aerodynamic heating of blunt nose shapes at mach numbers up to 14 .results are presented from recent investigations of the aerodynamicheating rates of blunt nose shapes at mach numbers up to 14 . dataobtained in flight and wind-tunnel tests have shown that the flat-facedcylinder has about 50 percent the stagnation-point heating rates of thehemisphere over nearly the entire mach number range . tests made at amach number of 2 on a series of bodies made up of hemispherical segments of varying radius of curvature showed that slight amounts of curvaturecan decrease the local rates at the edge of the flat-faced cylinderswith only a slight increase in the stagnation rate . the total heattransfer to such slightly curved bodies is also somewhat smaller thanthe total heat transfer to flat-faced cylinders .comparison of several tests with theoretical heating-rate distributionsshowed that both laminar and turbulent local rates can be predicted byavailable theories /given the pressure distribution about the body/reasonably well, although the scatter of the available data still leaves open the choice between the theories at the edge of the bodies, wherethey usually differ .tests on a flat-faced cylinder at a mach number of 2.49 and at anglesof attack up to 15degree showed the movement of the apparent stagnationpoint from the center of the body to the 50 percent windward station atcreased about 30 percent while that near the leeward edge decreasedabout 20 percent at 15degree angle of attack .preliminary results on a concave nose have indicated the possibilitythat this type of design may be developed to give heating ratessignificantly lower than even the flat-faced cylinder rates . the test results have also shown, however, the existence of an unsteady flow phenomenonwhich can increase the heating rates to extremely high values .
