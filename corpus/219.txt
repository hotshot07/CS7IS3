on the strength distribution of noise sources alonga jet .  the spatial distribution of noise sources along a jet isinvestigated by application of lighthill'stheory to regions of 'similar'profiles .  the analysis refers to thenoise power emitted by a 'slice' ofjet (section between two adjacent planesnormal to the axis) as a functionof distance x of the slice from the nozzle .it is found that this poweris essentially constant with x in the initialmixing region (x law), thenfurther downstream (say 8 or 10 diametersfrom the nozzle) falls offextremely fast (x law or faster) in thefully developed jet .  becauseof this striking attenuation of strengthwith distance, it is concluded thatthe mixing region produces the bulk ofthe noise and must dominate inmuffler behavior,. conversely, the 'fat'part of the jet must contributemuch less to the total noise power than is commonly supposed .  powell's experiments on the effects of nozzle velocityprofile on total noise power are interpretedqualitatively .  the behavior ofmultiple-nozzle or corrugated mufflers,both as to overall quieting andfrequency-shifting, is also interpretedin the light of the results .  thepossibility emerges that such mufflersmay be improved without seriousthrust loss by the addition of a sound-attenuating shroud .
