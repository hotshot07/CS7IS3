adiabatic wall temperature due to mass transfer cooling with acombustible gas .a recent technical note by sutton (1), with the above title, discussesthe influence of the burning of a transpiration coolant on the quantityof coolant necessary to maintain a given wall temperature .  the presentnote discusses the same problem in a way which has been found usefulin calculating the burning rates of solid and liquid fuels (2) .consider the transpiration cooling of a porous surface in a gas stream .then a simple modification of the general mass .
