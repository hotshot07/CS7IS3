on displacement thickness .  four alternative theoretical treatments of 'displacementthickness', and, generally, of the influence of boundary layersand wakes on the flow outside them, are set out, first fortwo-dimensional, and then for three-dimensional, laminar or turbulent,incompressible flow .  they may be called the methods of 'flowreduction', 'equivalent sources', 'velocity comparison' and  the principal expression obtained for the displacementthickness in three-dimensional flow may be writtenif, as orthogonal coordinates (x,y) specifying position on thesurface, we choose x as the velocity potential of the externalflow, and y as a coordinate, constant along the external-flowstreamlines, such that h dy is the distance between (x,y) andz is the distance from the surface, u and v are the x and y componentsof velocity, and u takes the value u just outside the boundary layer .
