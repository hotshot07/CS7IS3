Text: preliminary investigations of spiked bodies at hypersonic speeds .generally accepted solutions for the problems of hypersonic flightappear, at the moment, to be centered around the use of blunt bodies tominimize the heat-transfer rates . there are, however, several othersolutions to the problem, and, as part of an exploratory study of thesesolutions, a detailed examination has been made of the flow over bluntbodies equipped with a spike . these tests, carried out at a mach number of about 14 in the princeton helium hypersonic tunnel, haveinvestigated the effect of varying spike lengths for flat-faced andhemispherically-nosed axially symmetric bodies . detailed pressure distributionshave been obtained as well as heat-transfer rates .these exploratory studies have shown that the use of a spike protrudingfrom a hemispherical-nosed cylinder at m 14 decreased the pressurelevel by an order of magnitude and the heat transfer to a fraction ofthat measured on a hemisphere without a spike . the general techniqueappears to hold considerable promise for hypersonic flight .
