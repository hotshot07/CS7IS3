the surface oil flow technique as used in high speedwind tunnels in the united kingdom .  an examination has been made of thevarious versions of the surface oilflow technique used in different high speedwind tunnels .  to providebackground information for this investigationsome systematic tests were made ona simple model in a small supersonic tunnel .the experience gained made itpossible to explain many of the variationsin terms of the different operatingconditions of the tunnels .  the time taken to form a patternon a typical model is, to a firstapproximation, directly proportional tothe value of the parameter,the factor being 36,000 12,000 .  thetime taken appears to be independentof the initial thickness of the oil sheet .  a general procedure for the developmentof oil mixtures for any purposeis suggested .
