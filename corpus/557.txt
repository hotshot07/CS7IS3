a numerical comparison between exact and approximatetheories of hypersonic inviscid flow past slender bluntnosed bodies .  this note refers to paper of same title by feldman in ars j. 30,validity of blast wave theory cannot be justified on rational ortheoretical grounds because of different values of energy in crossflow field as calculated by this theory and by method ofcharacteristics .  present note questions this conclusion, shows reasonablygood agreement when energy is calculated for points where shocklocation, streamline pattern, and velocity, temperature, andpressure profiles are adequately defined, and still better agreementwhen energy is calculated from flow quantities provided by-characteristics method .  results are checked using data fromindependent source .  conclusion is reached that blast wave theory isstill valid .
