stagnation point heat transfer measurements in hypersoniclow density flow .in hypersonic, low reynolds number flow around a blunt body,the boundary-layer thickness approaches the shock-layerthickness (shock standoff distance) within the region ofcontinuum flow .  in this instance, the customary boundary-layerapproximations no longer apply .  hoshizaki and probsteinhave obtained solutions to the incompressible navier-stokesequations in the stagnation region of a blunt body in thishypersonic low reynolds number flow .  the results indicate thatheat-transfer rates are substantially higher than those predicted byincompressible boundary-layer theory .  probstein indicated thatthe actual heat-transfer rates would be correspondingly higherthan the predictions of fay and riddell .  these findings are ofparticular importance in the atmospheric entry phase ofrecoverable satellites .
