Text: stagnation point heat transfer measurements at supersatellite speeds .  brief description of experiments performed by using shock tubetechniques for measurement of the stagnation point heating of a bluntbody over a stagnation enthalpy range of 650 to 900,corresponding to velocities between 32,000 ft. per sec. and 39,000ft per sec., respectively .  data thus provided are used forcomparison with theory .
