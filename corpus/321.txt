improved numerical solution of the blasius problem with three-pointboundary conditions .the blasius equation describes the velocity distribution resulting fromlaminar, constant-pressure mixing of a stationary fluid layer and amoving stream . in connection with a numerical procedure for the univacbased on analytic continuation of the function f' . high-speed computers now make it feasible to use analytic continuation for numericalintegration of single-point boundary-value problems such that, withinthe limits of taylor's expansion, truncation error may be madearbitrarily small . a brief description of the application of theroutine is given .
