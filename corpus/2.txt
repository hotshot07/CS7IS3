Text: simple shear flow past a flat plate in an incompressible fluid of smallviscosity .in the study of high-speed viscous flow past a two-dimensional body itis usually necessary to consider a curved shock wave emitting from thenose or leading edge of the body .  consequently, there exists aninviscid rotational flow region between the shock wave and the boundarylayer .  such a situation arises, for instance, in the study of thehypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate .  the situation is somewhatdifferent from prandtl's classical boundary-layer problem . in prandtl'soriginal problem the inviscid free stream outside the boundary layer isirrotational while in a hypersonic boundary-layer problem the inviscidfree stream must be considered as rotational .  the possible effects ofvorticity have been recently discussed by ferri and libby .  in thepresent paper, the simple shear flow past a flat plate in a fluid of smallviscosity is investigated .  it can be shown that this problem can againbe treated by the boundary-layer approximation, the only novel featurebeing that the free stream has a constant vorticity .  the discussionhere is restricted to two-dimensional incompressible steady flow .
