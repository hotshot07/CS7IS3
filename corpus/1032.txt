Text: on the conservativeness of various distributed force systems .the necessity of determining the conservativeness of force systems ininstability problems is discussed in reference 1 .  it is shown that,whereas kinetic methods are generally applicable for the determinationof instability loads, the statical methods usually employed are validonly for conservative and nongyroscopic systems .  small changes inthe character of the loading could make an otherwise conservativesystem nonconservative and cause a large change in the magnitude of thebuckling load .  the buckling load of the cantilever column examplein reference 1 is, for tangential end loading, eight times that forconservative, constant directional loading .
