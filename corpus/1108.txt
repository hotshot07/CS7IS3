Text: a study of second-order supersonic flow theory .  an attempt is made to develop a second approximation to thesolution of problems of supersonic flow which can be solved byexisting first-order theory .  the method of attack adopted is aniteration process using the linearized solution as the first step .  for plane flow it is found that a particular integral of theiteration equation can be written down at once in terms of thefirst-order solution .  the second-order problem is therebyreduced to an equivalent first-order problem and can be readilysolved .  at the surface of an isolated body, the solution reducesto the well-known result of busemann .  the plane case isconsidered in some detail insofar as it gives insight into thenature of the iteration process .  again, for axially symmetric flow the problem is reduced to afirst-order problem by the discovery of a particular integral .for smooth bodies, the second-order solution can then becalculated by the method of von karman and moore .  bodieswith corners are also treated by a slight modification of themethod .  the second-order solution for cones represents aconsiderable improvement over the linearized result .second-order theory also agrees well with several solutions for otherbodies of revolution calculated by the numerical method ofcharacteristics .  for full three-dimensional flow, only a partial particularintegral has been found .  as an example of a more generalproblem, the solution is derived for an inclined cone .  thepossibility of treating other inclined bodies of revolution andthree-dimensional wings is discussed briefly .
