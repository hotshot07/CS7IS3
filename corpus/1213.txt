heat transfer to slender cones in hypersonic flow,including effects of yaw and nose bluntness .  as part of a general study of the aerothermodynamiccharacteristics of flight of hypersonic vehicles, an investigation oflaminar heat transfer to slender yawed cones has been conducted .experiments have been made in the cal 11- by 15-in. shocktunnel at mach numbers from 11 to 13 and at yaw angles up towere tested .  the heat-transfer rates are compared with theoreticalpredictions .  the effects on the local heat-transfer rates of theboundary-layer displacement thickness, transverse curvature, yaw,nose bluntness, and the entropy sublayer are discussed .  it isshown that, at zero yaw, the experimental data for the sharpcone are in good agreement with theory when boundary-layerdisplacement and transverse-curvature effects are included .for the yawed sharp cone, the heat-transfer rates along themost windward streamline are in good agreement with reshotko'stheory for yaw angles up to 3 .  at larger yaw angles, theexperimental heat transfer was found to be greater than thatpredicted theoretically .  however, at these yaw angles theheat-transfer distribution on the windward side was in goodagreement with laminar-boundary-layer calculations based on anassumption of local similarity .  the zero-yaw tests of the bluntedcones showed qualitative agreement with cheng's shock-layertheory for slender blunt-nose bodies .
