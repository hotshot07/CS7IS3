Text: comparison of theoretical and experimental creep bucklingtimes of initially straight, centrally loaded columns .  the creep-buckling times of initially straight, centrally loadedcolumns as predicted by the hypotheses of shanley, gerard,and rabotnov and shesterikov are compared with appropriateexperimental data .  it is found that the theoretical predictionsare generally conservative, due possibly to the fact that thehypotheses predict initial instability times while the experimentsnormally record final collapse times .  of the three hypotheses,that of gerard generally gives predictions which agree best withthe experimental data .
