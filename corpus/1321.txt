Text: effects of a flexible boundary on hydrodynamic stability .purpose of paper is to examine theoretically the use of coatings ofelastic materials to prevent transition from laminar to turbulent flow . theory is extension to flexible boundary of the small-disturbancetollmien-schlichting stability theory and makes use of /tietjensfunction/ and other functions that occur in solution of orr-sommerfeldequation . it is shown how solutions for flexible wall can be obtainedfrom solutions for rigid boundary .outline and discussion is given first for tollmien-schlichting stability theory for rigid wall, then for theory for flexible boundary . theoryis given both for a nondissipative and a dissipative flexible boundary . behavior of flexible medium itself is also examined .practical requirements are discussed . for example, a conclusion is that to avoid tollmien-schlichting instability, the wave velocity of surface waves in absence of flow should coincide with tollmien-schlichting wave velocity at wavelength of /most dangerous/ tollmien-schlichting waves . moreover, damping should be large enough to prevent surface waves fromdeveloping but not so large that tollmien-schlichting waves arepermissable . author states that a boundary that is both soft and light,one whose elastic constants are of same order as the dynamic pressure of the flow, may be practical for use at high speeds . this surface should have a small damping to avoid tollmien-schlichting type of instabilityand a large enough wave speed without flow to avoid surface waveinstability . although paper is somewhat sketchy in places, it givescomprehensive coverage of stability of laminar flow over a flexible wall .
