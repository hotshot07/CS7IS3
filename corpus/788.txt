an approximate boundary layer theory for semi-infinite cylinders ofarbitrary cross-section .an estimate is given of the distribution of skin frictional force perunit length, and of displacement area, on the outside of a semi-infinite cylinder, of arbitrary cross-section, moving steadily in a directionparallel to its generators . a pohlhausen method is employed with avelocity distribution chosen to yield zero viscous retarding force onthe boundary layer approximations . /the smallness of the fluidacceleration far from the leading edge has been pointed out by batchelorreasonable results atlarge distances from the leading edge . however,for a large class of cross-sections, which includes all convexcross-sections and locally concave cross-sections with re-entrant anglesgreater than 1/2, the method yields the expected square root growth ofthe boundary layer at the leading-edge, with a fairly closeapproximation to the coefficient, and it is supposed that the skin-frictionalforce and displacement area are given with reasonable accuracy along the whole length of the cylinder .results for the elliptic cylinder and the finite flat plate are given in closed form, valid for the whole length of the cylinder, and areexpected to be in error by at most 20 per cent . in addition, someestimate is given of the effect of corners on skin frictional force anddisplacement area .
