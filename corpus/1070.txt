buckling of orthotropic and stiffened conical shells .  donnell type stability equations for thin circular orthotropicconical shells are presented and solved for external pressure, axialcompression and combined loading .  the solution is likewise appliedto stiffened conical shells .  correlation with equivalent cylindricalshells yields a simple approximate stability analysis for orthotropicor ring-stiffened conical shells under hydrostatic pressure .  thegeneral instability of stiffened conical shells under hydrostaticpressure is also analysed by a more accurate approach .  preliminaryexperimental results for buckling of ring-stiffened conical shellsunder hydrostatic pressure are presented and discussed .
