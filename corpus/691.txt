Text: calculation procedure for thermodynamic transport, and flow propertiesof the combustion products of a hydrocarbon fuel mixture burned in airwith results for ethylene-air and methane-air mixtures .a procedure is presented whereby the composition, thermodynamicproperties, and transport properties of the dissociated combustionproducts of a fuel consisting of a mixed hydrocarbon compound burned inair may be calculated . equations and procedures for determiningsupersonic nozzle ordinates and flow properties for the dissociatedcombustion products are presented in an appendix . results are presentedfor the respective hydrocarbon fuels, methane and ethylene, at theequivalence ratios of 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, and 0.7 for pressures varyingbetween 10 and 8 x 10 atmospheres and temperatures from 200degree k to
