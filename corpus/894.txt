Text: flutter of a two dimensional simply supported buckledpanel with elastic restraint against edge displacement .  the critical flutter speed is evaluated for a two-dimensional thinbuckled panel with one surface exposed to a supersonic airstream and theother to still air at the same static pressure .  the panel is simplysupported along the leading and trailing edges by rigid edge membersseparated by an elastic member represented by a compression spring .the whole system is acted upon by a constant compressive force uniformlydistributed along the edge members .  the aerodynamic forces acting onthe deflected panel are found from two-dimensional /quasi-steady/theory, valid for slow oscillations where the downwash velocity is smallcompared with the speed of flow and provided that the mach number issufficiently greater than .  the elastic behaviour of the panel is givenby von karman's large deflection equations modified to cover initiallycurved plates .  the solution of the equations is carried out by meansof galerkin's method, which has been shown to give valid results fora panel with a non-zero bending rigidity .  the influence of the midplane compressive force carried by the panelitself, the initial buckle amplitude and the elastic restraint againstedge displacements is investigated, and curves are presented giving thecritical dynamic pressure ratio as a function of these variables .
