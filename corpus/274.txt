analysis of quartz and teflon shields for a particularre-entry mission .  the transient performance ofablation type heat protection shields istreated herein for the surface ofa vehicle returning from outer space to theearth .  the vehicle weighs 8640 kg,has a ballistic factor of 500 lb ft,re-enters with a speed of 11 km sec atratio of 0.5, and is subjected to amaximum deceleration of 7.7 times thegravity constant .  by use of well known equationsfor the heat transfer and the masstransfer at a heated surface, a numericalcalculation method is derived which, forthe investigated ablation processes,yields exact transient solutions of thefundamental system of partial differentialequations .  the method is appliedto various quartz shields and to oneteflon shield, which all evaporate soreadily under the conditions of theproblem at hand that practically no flowof molten shield material exists .the solutions also show comparatively smalltemperature changes parallel to the surface .  the results show that the noseof the vehicle is cooled predominantly bythe evaporation of the quartz or theteflon,. the rest of the vehicle's surfaceis cooled by radiation of the quartzor evaporation of the teflon .  the largemass transfer effects on the nose ofthe vehicle are detrimental since theresulting low surface temperatures preventthe radiative heat transfer out ofthe shield, which does not involve anymass loss, from being the desirablegoverning cooling factor .
