Text: on flow of electrically conducting fluids over a flatplate in the presence of a transverse magnetic field .  the use of a magnetic field to control the motion of electricallyconducting fluids is studied .  the boundary-layer solutions are foundfor flow over a flat plate when the magnetic field is fixed relative tothe plate or to the fluid .  theequations are integrated numerically forthe effect of the transverse magneticfield on the velocity and temperatureprofiles, and hence, the skin friction and rate of heat transfer .  it is concluded that the skin friction and the heat-transfer rate arereduced when the transverse magneticfield is fixed relative to the plateand increased when fixed relative to the fluid .  the total drag isincreased in all the cases studied .
