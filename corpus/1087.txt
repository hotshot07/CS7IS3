Text: convergence rates of iterative treatments of partial differentialequations .the development of high-speed digital computers has made feasible thenumerical solution by iterative methods of some partial differentialequations . the convergence rates of several such iterative methods areestimated here . it is found that with the familiar elementary iterative methods some quite simple problems require prohibitive computationallabor .the iterative methods here considered are related to the various formsof the southwell /relaxation method/ in that they involve successivelyapplied local corrections to improve an approximate solution . however,these iterative methods are routinized in conformity with therequirements of automatic computers while the relaxation method is flexible and depends in an essential way on the skill of its practitioners .
