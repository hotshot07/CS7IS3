Text: investigation of wing flutter at transonic speeds for six systematically varied wing plan forms .an investigation of the effects of systematic variations in wing planform on the flutter speed at mach numbers between 0.73 and 1.43 has been conducted in the 26-inch langley transonic blowdown tunnel . the angleof sweepback was varied from 0degree to 60degree on wings of aspectratio 4, and the aspect ratio was varied from 2 to 6 on wings withexperimental flutter speed and the reference flutter speed calculated on the basis of incompressible two-dimensional flow . this ratio,designated as the flutter-speed ratio, is plotted as a function of machnumber for the various wings . it is found that the flutter-speed ratioincreased rapidly past sonic speed for sweep angles of 45degree andless, indicating a favorable effect of mach number . for sweepback ofmach number range of the tests . reducing the aspect ratio had afavorable effect on the flutter-speed ratio which was of the order of 100percent higher for the aspect-ratio-2 wing than for the aspect-ratio-6wing . this percentage difference was nearly constant throughout themach number range, indicating that the effect of mach number was aboutthe same for all aspect ratios tested .
