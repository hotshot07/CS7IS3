Text: separation, stability and other properties of compressiblelaminar boundary layer with pressure gradient and heattransfer .  a theoretical study is made of the effect of pressure gradient,wall temperature, and mach number on laminar boundary-layercharacteristics and, in particular, on the skin-friction and heat-transfercoefficients, on the separation point in an adverse pressure gradient,on the wall temperature required for complete stabilization of thelaminar boundary layer, and on the minimum critical reynolds number forlaminar stability .  the prandtl number is assumed to be unity and thecoefficient of viscosity is assumed to be proportional to thetemperature, with a factor arising from the sutherland relation .  a simple andaccurate method of locating the separation point in a compressible flowwith heat transfer is developed .  numerical examples to illustrate theresults in detail are given throughout .
