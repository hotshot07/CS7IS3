Text: steady flow in the laminar boundary layer of a gas .if the boundary-layer equations for a gas aretransformed by mises's transformation, aswas done by karman   tsion for the flowalong a flat plate of a gas with unit prandtlnumber, the computation of solutions issimplified, and use may be made of previouslycomputed solutions for an incompressible fluid .for any value of the prandtl number, andany variation of the viscosity with the temperaturet, after the method has been appliedto flow along a flat plate (a problem otherwise treatedby crocco), the flow near the forwardstagnation point of a cylinder is calculated withdissipation neglected, both with the effect ofgravity on the flow neglected and with this effectretained for vertical flow past a horizontalcylinder .  the approximations involved by the neglectof gravity are considered generally,and the cross-drift is calculated when a horizontalstream flows past a vertical surface .when, and the boundary is heat-insulated,it is shown that the boundary-layerequations for a gas may be made identical, whatever bethe main stream, with theboundary-layer equations for an incompressible fluid with a certain,determinable, main stream .  themethod is also applied to free convection at a flat platevariation with altitude of the state of the surroundingfluid neglected) and to laminar flow inplane wakes, but for plane jets the conditions,previously imposed by howarth,are also imposed here in order to obtain simple solutions .
