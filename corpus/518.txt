Text: heat conduction through a polyatomic gas .  a heat conduction problem is set upwhich, in essence, simulates the conditionsarising when a plane shock wave reflectsfrom a co-planar solid boundary .  the gasis assumed to be polyatomic, with one  the quantity of primary interest isthe temperature of the solid at the interface,since this can be observed experimentallywithout much difficulty .  solutions areobtained for this quantity which cover arange of practically plausible relaxation timesand 'wall effect' parameters .  it is essentialto include proper temperature jumpboundary conditions for both active andrelaxing (or inert) energy modes .  thus it isnecessary to know accommodation coefficientsfor these modes of energy storage .the temperature jump effects are found todominate the (interface) solid's temperaturetime history, with relaxation effects playinga very secondary role .  the theoretical results are comparedwith some experimental observations andencouraging agreement is found .  as aresult of this agreement it proves possible toestimate the accommodation coefficientfor the active modes (in this case for thecombination platinum air), the pressurebeing about 15 atmospheres .  the pressuresensitivity of accommodation effects is commented on .
