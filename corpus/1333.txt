Text: aerodynamic forces on wings in non-uniform motion .  the problem of determining the aerodynamic forcesacting on wings of finite span in non-uniform motionin an incompressible, inviscid fluid is investigated .  the underlyingtheory is outlined in 2, and some known resultsfor the case of an aerofoil of infinite span are included in 3 .  it isshown in 4, by the use of operational methods,that the growth of lift function k (s) corresponding to a sudden unitchange of incidence can be derived from the liftfunction corresponding to simple harmonic translational motion .from results given by the writer for rectangularwings (1943) and tapered wings (1945) in simple harmonic motionthe corresponding values of k (s) are determined .the growth of lift function k (s) for a wing penetrating a uniformvertical gust can then be estimated as shown in 4and 5 .  by the use of approximate formulae for the growth of liftcurves given in fig. 2, the aerodynamic forcescorresponding to damped and growing translational oscillations arederived .  certain integrals involved in the theory are evaluated inappendix 1, and in appendix 2 the method of determiningk (s), when k (s) is known, is discussed in detail .  it is suggested that the aerodynamic forces acting on wingsof finite span for any type of motion can best be derivedfrom a knowledge of the forces corresponding to purelydivergent motion, which can be calculated by the methodsoutlined in this report .
