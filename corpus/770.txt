Text: the flow of a compressible fluid past a sphere .  the flow of a compressible fluid past a sphere fixedin a uniform stream is calculated to the third order ofapproximation by means of the janzen-rayleigh method .the velocity and the pressure distributions over thesurface of the sphere are computed and the terms involvingthe fourth power of the mach number, neglected in rayleigh'scalculation, are shown to be of considerable importance asthe local velocity of sound is approached on the sphere .the critical mach number, that is, the value of the machnumber at which the maximum velocity of the fluid past thesphere is just equal to the local velocity of sound, iscalculated for both the second and the thirdapproximations and is found to be, respectively, and .
