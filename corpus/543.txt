the stacking of compressor stage characteristics togive an overall compressor performance map .  a method of calculation is developed to compute the overallperformance of a multi-stage axial compressor, from a knowledge of theindividual stage characteristics, by a /stacking/ technique .compressor models are designed and their overall performancecalculated .  these results are compared to show, qualitatively, theeffect of alterations in design and stage performance on overallperformance and to find how compressors should be designedfor optimum performance .
