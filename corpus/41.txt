Text: on transition experiments at moderate supersonic speeds .  studies of transition over a flat plate at mach number 1.76were carried out using a hot-wire anemometer as one of theprincipal tools .  the nature and measurements of free-streamdisturbances at supersonic speeds are analyzed .  theexperimental results are interpreted in the light of present overallinformation on transition at supersonic speeds and conclusions asto further fruitful experiments are drawn .
