Text: analysis of effects of diffusion of a foreign gas intothe laminar boundary layer of a supersonic flow ofair in a tube .  adiabatic wall temperatures and recovery factors are calculatedfor pipe flows with an entrance mach number of 5 and with uniforminjection of helium .  predicted values of the recovery factorincrease slowly with increasing injection rate and with increasingdistance from the tube entrance .
