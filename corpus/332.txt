Text: similitude of hypersonic real-gas flows over slenderbodies with blunted noses .  on the basis of the hypersonic small-perturbation theory, thelaws of similitude for hypersonic inviscid flow fields over thin orslender bodies are examined, and the restrictions to ideal gaseswith constant specific heats and to bodies with pointed noses areremoved .  only steady plane or axisymmetric flows areconsidered .  inspection of the governing system of equations shows that asimilitude law exists for flow fields, under local thermalequilibrium, having the same free-stream atmosphere .  for flows ofideal gas with constant specific heats, the requirement of the samefree-stream atmosphere--i.e., the same composition, pressure, anddensity--can be replaced by the requirement of the same ratio ofspecific heats .  for flows over blunted wedges or cones, special laws ofsimilitude can be obtained .  application of the similarity rules is examined for the case ofhypersonic flows of an ideal gas with over flat plateswith blunt leading edges, and for the case of equilibrium airflows over wedges .  the possibility of simulating nonequilibriumflows over slender or thin bodies is also pointed out .
