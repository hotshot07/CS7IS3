free vibrations of continuous skin stringer panels .the determination of the natural frequencies and normal modes ofvibration for continuous panels, representing more or less typical fuselageskin-panel construction for modern airplanes, is discussed in this paperare considered . a numerical example is presented, and analyticalresults for a particular structural configuration agree favorably withavailable experimental measurements .
