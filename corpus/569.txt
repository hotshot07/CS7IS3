an experimental investigation of leading edge shock wave boundary layerinteraction at mach 5.8 .the boundary layer on a slender body tends to be very thick athypersonic speeds . it interacts with the external flow by producing largerflow deflections near the leading edge than those due to the body aloneflow around the boundary layer gives rise to an induced pressure with anegative gradient which thins the boundary layer and increases the skinfriction with respect to the zero pressure gradient value .experiments on a flat plate with a sharp leading edge have beenperformed in the galcit 5-dash by 5-dash in. mach 5.8 hypersonic windtunnel . the induced pressure was measured by means of orifices in theplate surface . profiles of mach number, velocity, mass flow, pressure,and momentum deficiency were calculated from impact pressure surveysnormal to the plate surface made at various distances from the leadingedge .the results are as follows . /1/ the induced pressures are 25 per centhigher than the weak interaction theory . /2/ the boundary layer and the external flow are distinctly separate for as low as 6,000 . /3/ theshock wave location is in good agreement with that predicted by thefriedrichs theory for a body shape equivalent to the observedboundary-layer displacement thickness . /4/ expansion waves reflected from theshock are weak . /5/ the average skin-friction coefficient tends towardand nearly matches the zero pressure gradient value downstream, butincreases to approximately twice that value as the leading edge isapproached .
