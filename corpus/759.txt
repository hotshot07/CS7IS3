Text: stability investigation of a blunted cone and a bluntedogive with a flared cylinder afterbody at mach numbersfrom 0. 30 to 2. 85 .  a cone with a blunt nose tip and ablunt nose tip and a 20 flared cylinderafterbody have been tested in freeflight over a mach number range from 0.30to 2.85 and a reynolds number rangefrom 1 x 10 to 23 x 10 .  time histories,cross plots of force and momentcoefficients, and plots of the longitudinal-forcecoefficient, rolling velocity,aerodynamic center, normal-force-curve slope,and dynamic stability are presented .with the center-of-gravity location at aboutmodels were both statically and dynamicallystable throughout the mach numberrange .  for the cone, the average aerodynamiccenter moved slightly forward withdecreasing speeds and the normal-force-curveslope was fairly constant throughoutthe speed range .  for the ogive, the averageaerodynamic center remainedpractically constant and the normal-force-curveslope remained practically constant toa mach number of approximately 1.6 wherea rising trend was noted .  maximum dragcoefficient for the cone, with referenceto the base area, was approximately 0.6,and for the ogive, with reference to thearea of the cylindrical portion, wasapproximately 2.1 .
