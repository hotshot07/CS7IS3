Text: calibration of the standard pitot-static head usedin the rae low speed wind tunnels .  recent results of tests in ther.a.e. wind tunnels concerned withthe measurement of pressure distributionshave shown slight discrepanciesbetween the readings of various staticpressure tubes and calculatedpressure distributions .  as a consequencesome doubt was felt concerningthe calibrations of tunnel static pressureand upon the validity of thereading given by the standard pitot-statichead .  it was therefore decided to check thestandard pitot-static headused in the r.a.e. wind tunnels, against aninstrument similar to themeasurements of staticpressure were also made using a long tube wherethe interference from headand support is calculated to be small .  this note gives the results of testsmade in the 5 ft open jet windtunnel and the no. 1 11 ft wind tunnelin order to determine thenecessary correction to the reading of staticpressure given by the r.a.e.pitot-static head .  the tests were madeduring september and october, 1951 .
