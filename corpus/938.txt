Text: calculations for the stability of thin conical frustumssubjected to external uniform hydrostatic pressureand axial loads .  calculations are presented for the problem of the stability ofconical shells subjected to combined external uniformhydrostatic pressure and axial tension or compression .  stressinteraction curves are found to vary only slightly as a function of theratio of the end radii of the cone .
