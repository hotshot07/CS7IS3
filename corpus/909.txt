Text: the effect of jet noise on aircraft structures .  the present state of knowledge on theproblem of fatigue failure dueto vibrations excited by jet noise is reviewed .it is concluded that it shouldcurrently be possible to make reasonableestimates of the stress levels set upin a structure by jet noise but, in general,the resultant fatigue life of thecomponents cannot be estimatedwith any confidence .
