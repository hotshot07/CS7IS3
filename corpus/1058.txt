the conical disk spring .  this paper presents approximate formulasto describe the behavior of the conicaldisk spring .  it is assumed that the shallowconical shell remains conical whensubjected to the axially symmetric edge loads .the principle of stationary potentialenergy is used to derive the relations betweenload and deflection .  formulas relatingthe applied loads, stresses, and deflections aregiven for several types of edgeconstraint .  the analysis is essentially a refinementand extension of the previous workof almen and laszlo .
