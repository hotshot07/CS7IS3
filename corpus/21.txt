Text: on heat transfer in slip flow .a number of authors have considered the effect of slip on the heattransfer and skin friction in a laminar boundary layer over a flat plate .reference 1 considers this by a perturbation on the usual laminarboundary-layer analysis while some other studies.dash e.g., referencethe impulsive motion of an infinite plate .
