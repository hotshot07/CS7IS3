Text: recent advances in nonequilibrium dissociating gasdynamics .  the purpose of this paper is to review some recentadvances in the study of gasdynamic problems includingeffects of chemical reactions .  to provide a background forthe study the general concepts shall be outlined briefly .  thediscussions of the recent developments are restricted toinviscid flow problems only, neglecting viscosity, heatconduction and diffusion .  particular attention is directed to recentadvances in analyses of nonequilibrium dissociating gasflows .  in the hypersonic flight regime, high stagnationenthalpies sufficient to cause dissociation are realized .  whenthe time to reach equilibrium is comparable with the time ittakes for a fluid particle to pass through the flow, then thereexist regions of the flow field where nonequilibrium states areencountered .  a brief survey of both the linear and thenonlinear methods of treatment of these nonequilibrium flows,including some new developments that have not appearedelsewhere, will be presented .
