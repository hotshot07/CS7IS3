Text: on the low aspect ratio oscillating rectangular wingin supersonic flow .  the laplace transform ofthe lift distribution on an oscillatingrectangular wing in a supersonic flow is obtainedby separating the linearised equationfor the velocity potential in elliptic (cylindrical)co-ordinates .  the results for the caseof no spanwise distortion are expanded in ascendingpowers of the aspect ratio in orderto compare with the slender body theory, and thelongitudinal stability derivatives arecalculated .  it is found that at either supersonicor transonic speeds single-degree-of-freedom instability in pitch is impossible insofaras the fourth power of the aspectratio is neglected .
