Text: the stability under axial compression and lateral pressureof circular cylindrical shells with a soft elasticcore .  the stability under axial compression and lateral pressure of afinite circular-cylindrical shell with an elastic core is treated bymeans of donnell's equations .  the stability criterion isinvestigated in detail for the general cylinder under axial compression orlateral pressure and for a particular cylinder under combinedloading .  comparisons are made with available experimentaldata .
