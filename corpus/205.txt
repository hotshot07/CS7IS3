a correlation of airfoil section data with the aerodynamicloads measured on a 45 sweptback wing at subsonic machnumbers .  an investigation has been made of the possibility of correlatingairfoil section data with measured pressure distributions over a 45sweptback wing in the mach number range from 0.50 to 0.95 at afree-stream reynolds number of approximately 2 million .the wing had an aspect ratioof 5.5, a taper ratio of 0.53, naca 64a010 sections normal to thequarterchord line, and was mounted on a slender body of revolution .  at mach numbers of 0.85 and below, and for wing normal-forcecoefficients below the maximum normal-force coefficient for aninfinite-aspect-ratio wing yawed 45 to the flow (derived from airfoil sectiondata by simple sweep relations), good correlation was obtained over mostof the wing between wing-section and two-dimensional-airfoil pressuredistributions .  for greater normal-force coefficients lateralboundary-layer flow permitted the inboard wing sections to rise to high maximumsection normal-force coefficients .  the effectiveness of this lateralboundary-layer flow disappeared towards the tip .  for all mach numbers,the influence of plan-form effects on the pressure distributions limitedthe quality of the correlation at the 20- and 95-percent-semispanstations .  above a mach number of about 0.85 the shock wavesoriginating at the juncture of the body and the wing trailing edge spread overthe span, preventing further application of two-dimensional data .  the spanwise load distributions at moderate normal-force coefficientscould be predicted from span-loading theory for the entire mach numberrange of the tests .
