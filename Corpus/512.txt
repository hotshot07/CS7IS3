quasi-cylindrical surfaces with prescribed thicknessdistributions .  a formula for the supersonic velocity field in terms of a givensurface distribution of sources is applied to points lying in thesurface .  an equation giving the camber shape of a quasicircular-cylindrical surface in terms of a prescribed thickness distributionis derived and the half ring wing with prescribed thickness distributionis discussed as an example .
