the effect of helium injection at an axially symmetric stagnationpoint .an effective means of protecting the surface of a hypersonic re-entryvehicle is to inject small quantities of a lightweight gas into theboundary layer through a porous wall .  this process, which is knownas mass-transfer cooling, protects the surface in two ways .  firstof all, as the injected gas or coolant passes from the reservoir throughthe wall to the surface, a considerable quantity of heat is absorbed asits temperature is raised from the reservoir temperature to the wallsurface temperature .  characteristically, lightweight gases haverelatively high specific heats .secondly, the transfer of mass and enthalpy by convection and diffusionnormal to the surface alters the characteristics of the boundarylayer in such a manner as to reduce the temperature gradient at thewall, and, hence, the conductive heat transfer at the wall .  this issometimes referred to as the blowing effect .
