application of second-order shock-expansion theoryto several types of bodies of revolution .  second-order shock-expansion theory is utilized to obtain equationsfor the initial normal force curve slope, initial pitching moment curveslope, and zero-lift wave drag for several type bodies of revolution .bodies considered are the cone-cylinder, cone-cylinder-frustum,cone-cylinder-frustum-booster, cone-frustum, and cone-frustum booster .
