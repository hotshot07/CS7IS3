a theory of transonic aileron buzz, neglecting viscouseffects .  usaf-sponsored analysis of the unsteady perturbations oftwo-dimensional transonic flow around an airfoil, where local supersonicregions terminated by shock waves are present in the vicinity of theairfoil .  viscous effects are neglected, and a linearized theory ofthe perturbations due to harmonic oscillations of an aileron isdeveloped .  a series solution for the pressure distribution is obtained,and numerical results for the nonsteady hinge moment, from thefirst approximation to the solution, are presented .  as a result offlutter analysis a stability boundary for transonic aileron buzz isobtained .  comparison of the theoretical results with experimentalobservations shows satisfactory agreement .
