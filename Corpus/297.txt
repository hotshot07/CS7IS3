compressibility effects in magneto-aerodynamic flowspast thin bodies .  the effects of compressibility on the steady motion of a highlyconducting fluid past thin cylindrical bodies in the presence of amagnetic field are studied .  procedures are developed for thesolution of this class of magnetoaerodynamic problems over theentire mach number range and for all ratios of magnetic tofluid-dynamic pressure .  the results obtained are analogous either tothe ackeret theory or the prandtl-glauert rule of conventionalaerodynamics, depending on the relative values of the flow speedand the appropriate speed of propagation of magnetoacousticdisturbances .  the methods used and the physical interpretationof the solutions obtained vary according to the orientation of themagnetic field with respect to the flow direction .  the results of the theory are explained in terms of theanisotropic propagation of magnetoacoustic pulses studied previouslyby several authors .
