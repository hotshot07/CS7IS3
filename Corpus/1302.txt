the development of the boundary layer in supersonicshear flow .  the development of the boundarylayer in a velocity shear layer isdiscussed for two-dimensional flowand for axisymmetric flow of bothcompressible and incompressible fluids .it is shown that the solutionsobtained by li and glauert for thetwo-dimensional flow of anincompressible fluid are applicable in themore general case after suitabletransformations of coordinates havebeen made .  new definitions are shownto be necessary, and are given, forthe displacement and momentum thicknessesof such a boundary layer .  reynoldsnumbers based on these thicknesses aregiven, and it is shown that any phenomenonwhich occurs at a constant value of sucha reynolds number will occur at apoint which, as the length scale of theflow increases, first movesdown-stream and then moves slightly upstream .this is shown to be in qualitativeagreement with experimental results on ablunt cone in a supersonic flow .a quantitative comparison of the theoreticaland experimental values ofdisplacement and momentum thicknesses isattempted, and no disagreement isobvious,. unfortunately the accuracy of theexperiments so far available isinsufficient to give positive confirmationof the theory of this note .
