effect of slight blunting of leading edge of an immersedbody on the flow around it at hypersonic speed .  manufacturing and maintainance of ideally sharp leading edgesand noses is practically impossible, hence a discrepancy arisesbetween the theory established for sharp edges and actual flowaround slightly blunted edges, where a detached shock is formedwith a subsonic adjacent region .  semi-empirical method is workedout showing that the pressure distribution in the vicinity of theleading edge is the same for different thin profiles having the sameshape of bluntness on their edges or noses .  the data for a flatplate can be used for all of them .  for moderate supersonic speedthe pressure on the remaining body is practically unaffected by thenose bluntness, and can be computed from a sharp-edge theory .for high supersonic speed a slight blunting of the edge canconsiderably alter the pattern of flow over a large region .  the methodconsists in replacing blunted edge by action of concentratedforces on the flow,. it is applied to blunted wedge where it showsdoubling of the drag computed by classic theory, and to cones,where the drag of a blunted cone may become smaller than that ofa sharp one .
