orbit decay and prediction of the motion of artificial satellites .the rate of decay of elliptic satellite orbits, due to atmospheric drag, is investigated through variation of parameters and through use of anatmospheric model involving a power function between density andaltitude . this model is shown to fit actual conditions better than anexponential function .the effects of the equatorial belt and the rotation of the earth areinvestigated . the conclusion is reached that through these anomaliesatmospheric drag substantially affects the orbit elements, especiallythose defining the orbit plane .an alternate approach of variation of parameters is presented, by whicha direct relation between period decay and instantaneous densityconditions is established . this approach, by itself specifically adequatefor prediction work, also opens an avenue for systematic and unifiedevaluation of observed decay .
