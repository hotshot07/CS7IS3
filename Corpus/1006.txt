free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic .





free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic .  the inviscid flow of a perfect gas over blunt-nosed axisymmetricand two-dimensional bodies at zero angle of attack has been calculatednumerically on an ibm 7090 computer .  the computation consisted of thefuller blunt-body solution for the subsonic and transonic regions andthe method of characteristics for the supersonic region .  the flowfields about a number of blunt bodies were studied, and the calculatedresults showed good agreement with experimental shock-wave shapes,surface-pressure distributions, and flow-field surveys .
