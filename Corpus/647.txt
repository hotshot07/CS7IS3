bending of a uniformly loaded rectangular plate withtwo adjacent edges and the others either simply supportedor free .  the distribution of deflection and bending moment in auniformly loaded rectangular plate having two adjacentedges clamped and the others either simply supported orfree, are obtained by a method of superposition .numerical values are given for square plates and, in one case, theresults are compared with those obtained by anothermethod .
