calculated subsonic span loads and resulting stability derivatives ofunswept and 45degree sweptback tail surfaces in sideslip and steady roll .subsonic span loads and the resulting stability derivatives have beencalculated for a systematic series of vertical- and horizontal-tailcombinations in sideslip and in steady roll in order to provideinformation embracing a wide range of probable tail configurations . all calculations were made by application of the discrete-horseshoe-vortexmethod to the problem of estimating loads on intersecting surfaces . the investigation covered variations in vertical-tail aspect ratio, theratio of horizontal-tail aspect ratio to vertical-tail aspect ratio, the effects of horizontal-tail dihedral angle /for the sideslip case/, andthe effects of vertical position of the horizontal tail for surfaceshaving their quarter-chord lines swept back 0degrees and 45degrees . the results of the investigation are presented in charts from which thespan loads for the various conditions can be obtained . the resultingstability derivatives are presented as vertical- and horizontal-tailcontributions as well as total-tail-assembly derivatives .the results of this investigation, which was made for a wider range ofgeometric variables than previous studies, showed trends which were ingeneral agreement with the results of previous investigations . alsopresented in this paper and used in the computations is an extensivetable of values of sidewash due to a rectangular vortex .
