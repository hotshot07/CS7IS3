on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells .





on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells .  an experimental investigation wasmade (1) to evaluate previouslypublished theoretical procedures forthe prediction of stressdistribution for cases of radially symmetricabrupt change in wall thickness ofthin-walled cylinders subject tointernal pressure and (2) toinvestigate the significance of stressesattributable to the presence ofthickness changes typical of design practice .one theory was adequate initself for solution of the case of continuousmiddle surface,. use of thesecond theoretical procedure was requiredto determine the additionalstresses arising from discontinuous middlesurfaces at the change inthickness .  comparisons were made betweentheoretical and experimental stressdistributions for cases with continuousmiddle and continuous innersurfaces for radially symmetric changes inwall thickness of a cylindersubject to internal pressure for diameterto larger wall thickness ratiosof 117 and 28 and for the case of acontinuous outer surface for a ratioof 28 .  in all tests the ratio of wallthicknesses at the change in wallthickness was 0.4 .  there was reasonably good correlationbetween theoretical andexperimental curves of stress distribution .on the basis of thiscorrelation, it was concluded that the applicabletheories were valid .  itwas shown that inclusion of the stressesarising from the condition ofdiscontinuous middle surfaces at a changein thickness has an importanteffect on stress distribution .  in the case of a cylinder with acontinuous outer surface, themaximum mean effective stress was of sufficientmagnitude to indicate thatthis geometry should be avoided in designif possible .  the maximummean effective stress was not increased toa significant degree by thepresence of a change in wall thickness inthe other cases .
