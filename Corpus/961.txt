compressible two dimensional jet mixing at constantpressure .  an analysis is made of turbulent constant pressure mixing for acompressible jet boundary, taking into consideration effects of theinitial boundary layer .  velocity profiles in the mixing region arerepresented in a transformed plans by one-parameter families of curves,with no specification for the mixing mechanism beyond that of anexchange coefficient concept being made .  the exchange coefficient isrepresented by the bornel function of an integral transform for the xcoordinate of an intrinsic system of coordinates .  this intrinsicsystem and the physical coordinate system are related by means of amomentum integral .  satisfactory correlation of theory and experimental low-speed datais obtained with a simple form of kernal function .  an asymptotic solution, corresponding to a fully developed velocityprofile in the jet boundary, allows the calculation of the mechanicalenergy level along the separating streamline in the jet boundary withoutthe use of empirical information .
