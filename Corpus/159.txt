numerical methods for transient heat flow .  this paper deals with the application of numericalmethods for the solution of heat-conduction problems,their generality being extended in the following ways ..may proceed most rapidly to a solution, or may proceedmore slowly and with greater precision,. (b) criteria aredeveloped for the choice of modulus to insure convergence .this is most important at a convective surface,. (c) amethod is developed for handling k and c when theseproperties vary independently with temperature .  acomprehensive appendix gives the derivations, and the use ofequations and charts is demonstrated by typicalexamples .
