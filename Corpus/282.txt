jet effects on base pressure of conical afterbodiesat mach 1. 91 and 3. 12 .  data are presented which show the effect of a jet on base pressurefor a series of conical afterbody-jet-nozzle combinations havingboat-tail angles that varied from 0 to 11 and base-to-jet diameter ratiosthat varied from 1.11 to 2.67 .  the jet nozzles had exit angles from 0to 20 and were designed for exit mach numbers from 1.0 to 3.2 .pressure ratios up to 30 were tested for both a cold (air) and a hotnumbers of 1.91 and 3.12 .  in general, base pressure increased for increasing values ofboat-tail angle, nozzle angle, jet temperature, and jet total pressure andfor decreasing values of base-to-jet diameter ratio, jet mach number,and free-stream mach number .  the addition of tail surfaces producedonly small changes in base pressure .  for all variables, base pressure is governed by the maximumpressure rise that can be supported by the wake fluid in the region of thetrailing shock .  the wake pressure ratio is in turn governed by the jetand free-stream mach numbers adjacent to the wake region and by thestate of the boundary layer on the boattail and on the nozzle .  values of wake pressure ratio computed using the theory of korst,page, and childs were in good agreement with experimental values forconvergent nozzles .
