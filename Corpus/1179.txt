a theory of asymmetric hypersonic blunt-body flows .two-dimensional asymmetric and three-dimensionalinviscid blunt-body flows are analyzedusing a new method .  the method is inverse, thatis, the shock-wave shape and freestreamconditions are taken as known, and the body shapeand flow field are to be determined .results at zero angle of attack are obtained as a specialcase of the general problem .  solutions atzero angle are calculated for a variety of body shapesat freestream mach numbers ranging frominfinity to 1.85 .  the ratio of specific heats, is takenas 1.4 .  comparison with results obtainedusing van dyke's and garabedian's numericalsolutions indicates that the method underconsideration is more accurate than the van dykemethod for determining stand-off distance .solutions are obtained for parabolic and paraboloidalshock waves at small angle of attack andinfinite freestream mach number,. assumes thevalues 1.4, 1.2, 1.1, and 1.05 .  for all cases,the streamline that wets the body passes throughthe shock wave slightly above the pointwhere the shock is normal and thus does not possessmaximum entropy .  these resultsprovide counter examples to the conjecture that anyisolated convex body in a supersonic streamis wetted by the streamline of maximum entropy .
