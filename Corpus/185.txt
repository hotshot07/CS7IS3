some possibilities of using gas mixtures other than inaerodynamic research .a study is made of the advantages that can be realized incompressible-flow research by employing a substitute heavy gas in place of air .most heavy gases considered in previous investigations are either toxic,chemically active, or (as in the case of the freons) have a ratio ofspecific heats greatly different from air .  the present report is basedon the idea that by properly mixing a heavy monatomic gas with asuitable heavy polyatomic gas, it is possible to obtain a heavy gasmixture which has the correct ratio of specific heats and which isnontoxic, nonflammable, thermally stable, chemically inert, andcomprised of commercially available components .calculations were made of wind-tunnel characteristics for 63 gas pairscomprising 21 different polyatomic gases properly mixed with each ofthree monatomic gases (argon, krypton, and xenon) .  for a givenmach number, reynolds number, and tunnel pressure, a gas-mixturewind tunnel having the same specific-heat ratio as air would beappreciably smaller and would require much less power than acorresponding air wind tunnel .  analogous though different advantagescan be realized in compressor research and in firing-range research .the most significant applications, perhaps, arise through selecting andproportioning a gas mixture so as to have at ordinary wind-tunneltemperatures certain dimensionless characteristics which air atflight temperatures possesses but which air at ordinary wind-tunneltemperatures does not possess .  characteristics which involve therelaxation time (or bulk viscosity), the variation of viscosity withtemperature, and the variation of specific heat with temperature fallwithin this category .  other applications arise in heat-transferresearch since certain gas mixtures can be concocted to have any prandtlnumber in the range at least between 0.2 and 0.8 .
