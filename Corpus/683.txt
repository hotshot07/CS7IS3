the use of conical camber to produce flow attachment at the leadingedge of a delta wing and to minimize the lift-dependent drag at sonicand supersonic speeds .in an attempt to avoid flow separation at the leading edge of a thindelta wing with subsonic leading edges, an attachment line is prescribed there . this is done by requiring the load, as predicted by attachedflow theory, to vanish along the leading edge at the design liftcoefficient . for sonic speed, a complete account of this flow is givenin terms of slender wing theory and the load distributions corresponding to arbitrary conical camber are calculated . for supersonic speedsload distributions arising in the slender wing theory are considered and the corresponding conical camber distributions are found by linearizedtheory . the lift-dependent drag for a given lift is then minimized with respect to the coefficients of a linear combination of these loaddistributions . it is found that the lift-dependent drag factor for theseconically cambered wings approaches the value it takes for the attachedflow/in which leading edge suction occurs/past the uncambered wing atthe same mach number, as more terms are included in the linearcombination . however, when the leading edge is almost sonic an appreciablereduction is predicted . the corresponding load distributions and wingshapes are calculated and drawn . the optimum shapes for a fixed numberof terms resemble flat plates drooped downwards near their edges, sothat the localised leading edge suction is replaced by a distributedforce on a forward-facing surface, producing an effect of similarmagnitude .
