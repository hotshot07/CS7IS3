the bending of uniformly loaded clamped plate in theform of a circular sector .  the deflexion of a uniformly loadedplate in the form of a semicircle clampedalong its boundary is obtained by amethod due to weinstein .  this problemrequires the solution of the biharmonicequation where z is given,subject to the conditions that w = 0 andon the boundary, n being thedirection of the outward normal .  the solutionis expressed in the formwhere, writing is foundby solving (in succession) two harmonicequations of the forms where z maybe zero, and where f andhave to satisfy certain boundary conditions .the constants are then determinedto satisfy the boundary condition .  numerical calculations show that five or sixterms of the series give agood approximation to the accurate value asjudged by the closeness with whichthe approximate solution satisfies the boundarycondition .  theprocedure to be adopted in the case of the generalcircular sector and for non-uniformloading is indicated briefly .  the connexion between the deflexion problemand that of plane strain in whichthe stress function satisfies the equation,where and have givenvalues on the boundary, is discussed as a preliminaryto the further considerationof the latter problem by a method of the same type .
