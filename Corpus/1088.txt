iterative methods for solving partial difference equations of elliptictype .this paper considers linear systems /1/ where a includes matrices of asort frequently occurring in the solution of elliptic partialdifferential equations by difference methods /in particular, a o/ . rewriting superscript is number of iteration cycle/ are used to compute uwhen u are used . also, one may /over-relax/ ..ser. a. 210, 307-357 /1910/ who suggested changing from time to timeto speed up convergence . in the present paper over-relaxation /withfixed w/ is combined with immediate introduction of newly-computed u's,a la gauss-seidel . various theorems on convergence are proved$. inparticular, it is shown that there exists an ordering of the equationsand an optimum value wb such that in general /3/ converges much morerapidly than the gauss-seidel method /w 1/ . means are suggested forestimating wb,. the sensitivity of the rate of convergence to the choice of w is studied . the paper concludes with a theoretical comparison ofgauss-seidel and the method proposed, /successive over-relaxation/, forsolving dirichlet's difference problem over a square using a high-speedcomputing machine .
