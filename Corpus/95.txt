temperature distribution and thermal stresses in amodel of a supersonic wing .  the transient temperature distribution and the thermalstresses in an idealized wing structure considered by hoff andtorda in reference 1 are determined .  only the effects ofaerodynamic heating and of heat conduction are included,. radiationand convection effects are neglected .  the present work differsfrom that of reference 1 in that the conduction from the cap tothe web is considered when the temperature of the cap iscalculated, and the spar cap temperature is assumed to be a functionof both space and time .  graphs of temperature and thermalstress distributions are presented, and the results are comparedwith those of reference 1 .
