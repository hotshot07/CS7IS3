free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic .





free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic .  charts of thermodynamic properties for equilibrium air are presentedwith sufficient accuracy to permit the calculation of flow parameters inhypersonic nozzles operating at stagnation temperatures up to 4,950 rand pressures up to 1,000 atm .  flow parameters calculated from thesecharts are presented for a series of stagnation temperatures betweenuse of these parameters, it is possible to calibrate a nozzle in theconventional way .  a method is also presented from which the flowparameters for conditions other than those chosen herein may becalculated .  real-gas effects on the calculation of a hypersonic nozzlecontour are shown by an example calculation in which the nozzle contourfor mach number 12 was determined by including real-gas effects, andthis contour was compared with one calculated by ideal-gasconsiderations .  also presented are the approximate limiting machnumbers at which equilibrium air will just condense for variouscombinations of stagnation temperatures and pressures .
