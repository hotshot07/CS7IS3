the quasi-cylinder of specified thickness and shellloading in supersonic flow .  the methods of the operationalcalculus are used to obtain a linearapproximation to the shape of the mean cambersurface of a quasi-cylinder in asupersonic flow in terms of its shell thicknessand loading distributions .  theanalysis deals with a generalised quasi-cylinder ,.that is one which, although lyingclose to a mean cylinder, need not possessaxial symmetry .  the quasi-cylinderis also permitted to be within the smalldisturbance field of other separatecomponents, e.g. a centre-body .  becausethe linearised theory is inadmissablefor internal duct flows close to and beyondthe first reflected characteristic cone,the present solution is likewise invalid closeto and beyond the position wherethis characteristic meets the mean cylinder .the work given here enables thecamber shapes of /ring-wings/, which havebeen used theoretically to reduce oreven nullify the wave-drag of a central slender-body,to be found .  an exampleillustrates the general method .
