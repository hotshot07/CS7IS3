analytical study of the tumbling motions of vehiclesentering planetary atmospheres .  the tumbling motion of vehiclesentering planetary atmospheres isanalyzed .  a differential equationgoverning the tumbling motion, itsarrest, and the subsequent oscillatorymotion is obtained and identifiedas the equation for the fifth painlevetranscendant .  an approximateanalytical solution for the transcendantis derived .  comparisons withresults obtained from numericalintegration of the exact equations ofmotion indicate that the solution for theangle-of-attack history issufficiently accurate to be of practical use .
