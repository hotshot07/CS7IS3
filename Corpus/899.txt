aerodynamic effects on boundary layer unsteadiness .  with a view to the study ofaerodynamic problems, a review is madeof boundary layer theory for a flatplate moving with a time-dependentvelocity .  unsteady effects are shownto enter according to the magnitudeof the ratio of time for diffusion to actthroughout the boundary layer to thecharacteristic time of the imposed unsteadiness .  it is concluded that a boundary layermay be considered quasi-steadyeven during extreme flight manocuvres .generation of acoustic noise purelyby boundary layer unsteadiness is generallysmall .  thermal and heat-transfereffects are cited .  unsteady boundary layer considerationsare important in damping oramplifying certain instabilities, such as flutterof panels and stalling flutter ofaerofoils .  in connection with the aerofoilproblem, laminar separationconcepts and the stagnation-point boundarylayer are described for unsteadyflow .  an analysis of aerofoil lift hysteresisis described, using unsteadylaminar boundary layer considerations, whichleads to a prediction ofcounter-clockwise hysteresis at maximum lift .
