some design problems of hovercraft .analysis of the influence various aerodynamic parameters have onthe performance of a simple peripheral jet system .  power weightratio, lift drag ratio, and effect of jet angles and thickness areeach considered .  structural requirements, optimum cushionpressure, and dynamic stability over waves are examined and thenrelated to the economics of ground-effect machine operation .
