some effects of variations in several parameters includingfluid density on the flutter speed of light uniformcantilever wings .  an experimental investigation has been made of some effects ofvariations in several parameters, including fluid density, on theflutter characteristics of light uniform cantilever wings .  theassortment of wings tested covered a variety of positions of the elastic axisand center of gravity and values of the aspect ratio of 8, 6, and 4 .the relative-density parameter (where k is representative of theratio of fluid density to wing mass) was varied over a range of valuesfrom 1.2 to nearly 14 .  special emphasis has been placed on the lowervalues .  the experimental investigation has been supplemented by ananalytical investigation based on the two-dimensional aerodynamic theory forincompressible flow .  in a few instances corrections for the effects offinite span have been made .  in general, the theoretical resultsfollowed the trends indicated by experiment except at very low values ofthe relative-density parameter .  for these low valuesthe analytical considerations employed indicated a freedom from flutternot found experimentally .  at higher values of the flutter-speedcoefficient is shown to decrease with decreasing values of andto be nearly proportional to the inverse of the square root of the airdensity .
