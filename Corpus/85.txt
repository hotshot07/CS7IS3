on trails of axisymmetric hypersonic blunt bodies flyingthrough the atmosphere .  the trail left in the atmosphere by a body moving at hypersonicspeeds is the subject of theoretical treatment .  the timesrequired for ionization and dissociation (and their inverse processes)to go to completion, when compared to the flow times of a gasparticle, are important in determining the observable effects ofhypersonic trails-i.e., emitted thermal radiation and reflectionof electromagnetic waves from the trail .  in order to simplify the theoretical treatment, the trail isdivided into two regions ..  (1) the expansion-controlled trail,which treats the behavior of the wake behind the body up to apoint, along the direction of flight, where the pressure decays tothe free-stream value and cooling is controlled principally by theexpansion of the flow, and (2) the conduction-controlled trail,where the trail cools mainly by diffusion of heat away from thehigh-temperature core .  the influence of the details of the body shape on theobservables are discussed and a simple computational procedure forthe behavior of the conduction-controlled trail is developed basedon integral methods .  results of calculations that assumethermodynamic equilibrium of the flow field give the values of thethermodynamic variables in the trail of a sphere, axialdistributions of emitted thermal radiation, and maps of electron densitydistribution .  it is shown that the cooling of theconduction-controlled trail is essentially due to conduction of heat and thatviscous effects are not important .  it is found that this portionof the trail does not widen as one proceeds downstream .  flightvelocities considered vary between 15,000 and 35,000 ft sec andaltitudes range between 100,000 and 250,000 ft .
