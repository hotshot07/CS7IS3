the flow of fluid along cylinders .the boundary layer equations for uniform flow parallel to the generators of any cylinder without corners are put into the form of a series oflinear third-order differential equations . the first three of these are the same as those obtained by seban and bond /1/ for a circularcylinder and solved by kelly /2/ . the rest have additional termsdepending on the radius of curvature of the cylinder and its derivatives . the problem is also attacked by a pohlhausen method as far as four terms of the series . for large distances from the front, rayleigh's method, asgiven by hasimoto /3/, gives the first two terms of an asymptoticexpansion for the drag . explicit calculations are made of the drag ofan elliptic cylinder of eccentricity 1/2 3 . there is evidence that thedrag is everywhere less than that of a circular cylinder of the sameperimeter .
