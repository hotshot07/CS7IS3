a theoretical and experimental study of oscillating wedge shapedaerofoils in hypersonic flow .aerodynamic stiffness and damping derivatives have been measuredin a /hypersonic gun/ wind tunnel for sharp and blunt-nosed twodimensional single wedge shapes oscillating in the pitching mode inhypersonic flow .  the results, which have been compared withtheoretical prediction, modified to account for leading edge bluntness,show that this may increase the damping by up to 50 percent for certainaxis positions .  details of the experimental technique designed tomeasure the derivatives in the short running times available aredescribed .
