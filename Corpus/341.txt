the analytical design of an axially symmetric lavalnozzle for a parallel and uniform jet .  the equations for the nozzle's contours are derived byintegration of the characteristic equations of the axially symmetric flow .since it is not possible to integrate these equationsmathematically in an exact form, it was necessary to find a way toapproximate the calculations .  the approximation offers itself byconsidering and comparing the conditions of the flow in a cone withthose in a nozzle, as a linearization of the characteristic equations .  the first part of the report deals with equations for thetransition curve by which the conical source flow is converted into aparallel stream of uniform velocity .  the equations are derivedby integration along a mach line of the flow in the region wherethe conversion takes place .  a factor f is introduced expressing arelation between the direction and the velocity of the flow alonga certain mach line .  f remains undetermined and is not involvedin the final equations .  in the second part of the report, the spherical sonic flowsection is converted into a plane circular section of the throat .the nozzle's contour adjacent to the throat is formed by the arcof a circle connected with the transition curve by a straight line .the gas dynamic properties of the boundary mach line arecalculated in table 1, the use of which shortens the calculationsconsiderably .
