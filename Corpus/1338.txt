investigation to determine effects of center of gravity location on thetransonic flutter characteristics of a 45degree sweptback wing .an experimental investigation has been conducted in the 26-inch langleytransonic blowdown tunnel to determine effects of center-of-gravitylocation on the transonic flutter characteristics of a 45degreeswept-back-wing plan form of aspect ratio 4.0 and taper ratio 0.6 .solid-construction models of the plan form with streamwise naca 65a004airfoil sections and center-of-gravity locations at approximately 34percent chord, 46 percent chord, and 58 percent chord, respectively, werefluttered at several mach numbers between 0.8 and 1.35 .it was found that, for streamwise mach numbers from 0.8 to 1.0, thevariation with mach number of the ratio of experimental flutter speed to a calculated incompressible flutter speed was not affected bycenter-of-gravity location . however, for mach numbers from 1.0 to 1.35, therewas an increase in flutter-speed ratio with mach number which wasdifferent for each center-of-gravity position . data from wings withsuccessively more forward center-of-gravity locations showedsuccessively larger values of flutter-speed ratio at mach numbers from 1.0 to
