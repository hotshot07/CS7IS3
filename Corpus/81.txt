compressible laminar flow and heat transfer about arotating isothermal disk .  the flow and heat transfer about a rotating isothermal disk arere-examined to include the effects of compressibility and propertyvariations .  if viscous dissipation is neglected,the compressible problem iscorrelated to the incompressible problem by assuming linear variationsof viscosity and thermal conductivity with temperature .  certaininaccuracies in several previous incompressible solutions are noted andcorrected herein .  the effect of compressibility appears as adistortion of the normal coordinate and normal velocity component and asa multiplicative factor in the heat-transfer coefficient, the nusseltnumber, and in the expressions for the skin-friction components andtorque required to rotate the disk .
