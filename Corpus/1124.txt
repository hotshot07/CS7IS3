design of missile bodies for minimum drag at very highspeeds - thickness ratio, lift, and center of pressuregiven .  newtonian flow theory has been used to develop a procedurefor the design of minimum drag bodies of revolution having agiven thickness ratio and center of pressure .  it is shown that the optimum body shape is independent oflift .  center of pressure location, however, exerts a powerfulinfluence on both the shape of the body and on the dragcoefficient at zero lift .
