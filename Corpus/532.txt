pitch-yaw stability of a missile oscillating in rollvia the second method of lyapunov .the stability theory of a. m. lyapunov, a popular topic inthe u.s.s.r., is receiving increasing attention elsewhere .this note describes lyapunov's /second method/ very brieflyand applies it to an aeronautical stability problem .
