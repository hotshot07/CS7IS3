boundary layer transition in the presence of streamwisevortices .  results of an experimental investigation of instability leadingto transition in the subsonic boundary layer flow along a flatplate are presented .  a series of wings was placed outside theboundary layer to produce streamwise vortices, which in turnmade the boundary layer three-dimensional--i.e., periodic inthickness in the spanwise direction .  hot-wire measurementswere made to trace the downstream development of thedisturbance or wave created by the vibrating ribbon .  as the wavetravels downstream, it is deformed into a three-dimensionalconfiguration by the three-dimensionality of the boundary-layerflow, but it is eventually damped out so long as it remains small inintensity .  it is only after the wave intensity exceeds a certainamount (which depends on the degree of boundary-layerthree-dimensionality) that the nonlinear effect manifests itself by therapid amplification of wave intensity, the rapid increase in wavethree-dimensionality, and the distortion in mean velocity profile .the appearance of nonlinear development inevitably leads to thebreakdown of laminar flow, and hence the onset of turbulence .there is present a mechanism by which the energy is transferredfrom one spanwise position to another so that the breakdown oflaminar flow occurs as a consequence of three-dimensionaldevelopment of the wave as a whole .
