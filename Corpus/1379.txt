hypersonic flight and the re-entry problem .paper reviews the possibilities and some of the main problems of threetypes of long-range vehicle, the ballistic, the glide, and the skiprocket . performance assessments are made on the basis of an ingenious,if debatable, conversion of the vehicle characteristics to the breguetformula . the problems of aerodynamic heating, aerodynamic loads andstability are briefly discussed, and other aspects of hypersonic flightfree molecule flow-dash are touched upon . the results on the wholefavor the glide vehicle for manned flight . the subsequent discussionon the paper includes references to multistaging and the use ofhigh-energy fuels .
