some aspects of air-helium simulation and hypersonicapproximations .  some illustrations of the differences that may be expected betweenresults obtained in hypersonic wind tunnels that employ air and resultsobtained in those that employ helium as the test medium (imperfect-gaseffects are not considered) are compiled and presented herein .  simpleexpressions are presented that demonstrate the possibility of simulatingair results in helium tests and of transforming helium data toequivalent air data .  nonviscous and viscous simulations are considered .  inmost cases, the methods and the general forms of the expressions forsimulation that are derived are applicable to any two ideal gases havingdifferent ratios of specific heats .
