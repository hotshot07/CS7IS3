the influence of aerodynamic heating on the flexuralrigidity of a thin wing .  this report considers the loss of flexural rigidity of a thin wing dueto the presence of middle-surface stresses resulting from aerodynamicheating .  the spanwise properties of the wing are assumed constant butthe wing section is arbitrary .  the loss of flexural rigidity iscomparable with the corresponding loss of torsional rigidity .
