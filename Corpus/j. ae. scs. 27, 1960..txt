experimental evaluation of heat transfer with transpiration
cooling in a turbulent boundary layer at m=3 .2.
  it is found that for prescribed velocity field, electrical field and
conductivity, the current can be calculated by integration .  work is
related to analytic investigation of the boundary layer in a
physically reasonable accelerator .
