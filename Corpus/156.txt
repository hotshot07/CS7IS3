the effect of shallow water on wave resistance .  the general character of experimentalresults dealing with the effect ofshallow water on ship resistance may bestated briefly as follows ..--at lowvelocities the resistance in shallowwater is greater than in deep water, thespeed at which the excess is firstappreciable varying with the type of vessel .as the speed increases, the excessresistance increases up to a maximum at acertain critical velocity, and thendiminishes .  with still further increase ofspeed, the resistance in shallowwater ultimately becomes, and remains, lessthan that in deep water at the same speed .the maximum effect is the morepronounced the shallower the water .for further details and references onemay refer to standard treatises, but onequotation may be made in regard tothe critical velocity ..  /this maximumappears to be at about a speed suchthat a trochoidal wave travelling at thisspeed in water of the same depth isabout times as long as the vessel .it was at one time supposedthat the speed for maximum increasein resistance was that of the wave oftranslation .  this, however, holds onlyfor water whose depth is less thanfor greater depths the speed of thewave of translation rapidly becomesgreater than the speed of maximumincrease of resistance ./  in a recentanalysis of the data, h. m. weitbrechtexpresses a similar conclusion by statingthat for each depth of water there isa critical velocity, but that the criticalvelocity does not vary as the squareroot of the corresponding depth .
