aerodynamic characteristics of propeller-driven vtolaircraft .  this paper discusses the two major configurations that are usuallyconsidered for achieving vtol while keeping the fuselage essentiallyhorizontal - that is, the tilt-wing and the deflected-slipstreamconfigurations .  because of the high turning losses incurred by deflected-slipstreamconfigurations in hovering and because of the wing-stalling problem ofthe pure tilt-wing configurations during the transition, it appears thata combination of the two principles should be used .  this tilt-wing andflap configuration should make use of a programed extensible-chordslotted flap together with a leading-edge high-lift device in order toavoid the performance and handling qualities problems associated withwing stalling during the transition while keeping the wing area as lowas possible for efficiency in cruising flight .
