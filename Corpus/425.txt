the solution of elastic plate problems by electrical analogies .a dynamic-analogy method for the solution of elastic plate problems isdescribed in this paper .  the electrical circuits developed here can beset-up and studied on an electric-analog computer .  problems involvingdeflections under constant load, transient vibrations, or normalmodes can be solved in this way .  the method of applying boundaryconditions to plates with irregular edges is given, together witha detailed description of the representation of the boundary conditionsfor a rectangular variable-thickness plate .  solutions that have beenobtained on the cal tech electric-analog computer are presented forthe static deflections and normal modes of a rectangular cantileverplate .
