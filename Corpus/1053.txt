spherical cap snapping .  a nonlinear boundary value problem for the determination ofthe rotationally symmetric deformations of a clamped sphericalcap under external pressure is solved by finite differences .  thenumerical solutions are obtained by employing a previouslydeveloped iteration procedure .  a special case of the differenceequations is solved explicitly and yields a justification of theiteration method as well as insight into the properties of the moreaccurate numerical solutions .  buckled and unbuckled equilibrium states are obtained andthe shape of the pressure-deflection curve which is usually assumedfor these states is verified for a large class of caps .  closeestimates are given for the upper and lower buckling loads and anintermediate buckling load--i.e., the /dead-weight/ load .  thestresses and deflections in the buckled and unbuckled states areexamined and compared with an asymptotic solution valid in theinterior of very thin shells .  boundary layers are found todevelop in the buckled states both as the loading increases and asthe thickness of the shell decreases .
