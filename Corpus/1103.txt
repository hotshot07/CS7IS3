pressures, densities and temperatures in the upper atmosphere .averaged and internally consistent values of atmospheric pressure,density, and temperature from the ground to an altitude of 219 km havebeen determined and compiled by the united states groups active inupper-atmospheric research by rockets . additional relevant data bysimilar groups engaged in research on meteors and on the anomalouspropagation of sound are also included, particularly in a brief discussionof variations with time and with place of these three atmosphericparameters .
