mass transfer cooling at mach number 4. 8.mass-transfer experiments on a 5 mil wire porous coneof 20 total angle have been conducted at usingair and helium injection .  details of the experimental techniqueare described in references 1 and 2 .  in the laminar boundarylayer the recovery factors and heat-transfer coefficients measuredwith zero injection agreed within per cent with theory .transition reynolds numbers observed on the porous cone withzero injection were half as large as observed on a smooth,impermeable model of identical geometry in the same channel, butinjection of large amounts of air or helium did not causetransition to move forward from its zero-injection position on theporous cone .  distributed roughness of this type apparently doesnot disturb impermeable wall theory, but it masks whatevereffective roughness may be caused by discrete pore injection .
