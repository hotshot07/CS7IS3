on turbulen flow between parallel plates .  the reynolds equations of motion of turbulent flow ofincompressible fluid have been studied for turbulentflow between parallel plates .  the number of theseequations is finally reduced to two .  one of these consists ofmean velocity and correlation between transverse andlongitudinal turbulent-velocity fluctuations only .the other consists of the mean pressure and transverseturbulent-velocity intensity .  some conclusions aboutthe mean pressure distribution and turbulent fluctuationsare drawn .  these equations are applied to two specialcases ..  one is poiseuille flow in which both plates areat rest and the other is couette flow in which one plate is atrest and the other is moving with constant velocity .  themean velocity distribution and the correlation canbe expressed in a form of polynomial of the co-ordinate inthe direction perpendicular to the plates, with the ratioof shearing stress on the plate to that of the correspondinglaminar flow of the same maximum velocity as aparameter .  these expressions hold true all the way across theplates, i.e., both the turbulent region and viscous layerincluding the laminar sublayer .  these expressions forpoiseuille flow have been checked with experimental dataof laufer fairly well .  it also shows that the logarithmicmean velocity distribution is not a rigorous solution ofreynolds equations .
