newtonian flow over a surface .a general method is presented forthe study of a three-dimensionalhypersonic flow about a body of arbitrary shape when .the manner of constructing a doubleasymptotic development inand is shown .  formulae are givenwhich enable the first three terms ofthis development to be obtained while neglecting .the theory is then applied to the case ofa body of circular-cone shape .  thepressure is given as a triple developmentin accordance with the precedingparameters and the angle of attack,. thisdevelopment neglects .  a. ferri'svortical layer is brought into evidence .a second application is devoted tocalculation of the total forces actingupon bodies of revolution at angles ofincidence, while neglecting .general formulae areestablished for the coefficients of axialforce, normal force and moments .the formulae are developed accordingto the powers of incidence, the firstterms of each formula being of very simple form .
