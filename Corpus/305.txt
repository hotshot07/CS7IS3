hypersonic strong viscous interaction on a flat platewith surface mass transfer .the present report gives an account ofthe development of anapproximate theory to the problem of hypersonicstrong viscous interactionon a flat plate with mass-transfer at theplate surface .  the disturbanceflow region is divided into inviscid andviscous flow regions .  thehypersonic small perturbation theory is appliedto the solution of the inviscidflow region .  the method of similar solutionsof compressible laminarboundary layer equations is applied to thetreatment of the viscous flowregion .  the law of surface mass-transferfor similar solutions is derived .the pressure and the normal velocity arematched between the inviscid andviscous flow solutions .  formulas for inducedsurface pressure, boundarylayer thickness, skin friction coefficient,and heat transfer coefficientare obtained .  numerical results and theirsignificance are discussed .future improvements are indicated .
