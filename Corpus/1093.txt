induced interference effects on jet and buried-fanvtol configurations in transition .  recent investigations of some jet and buried-fan configurationshave indicated that in the transition speed range, configurations withconsiderable area surrounding the jet or buried fan can encounter largelosses in lift and nose-up pitching moments due to the pressures inducedon the lower surfaces by the interaction of the jet and free-streamflow .  the obvious way of minimizing these effects is to reduce thesurface area surrounding the jets or buried fans, that is, to considerthese effects in the preliminary stages of the airplane design .
