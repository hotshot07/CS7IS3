a mixing theory for the interaction between dissipativeflows and nearly isentropic streams .  by means of a simplified theoretical /model,/ the present papertreats the general class of flow problems characterized by theinteraction between a viscous or dissipative flow near the surfaceof a solid body, or in its wake, and an /outer/ nearly isentropicstream .  for the present, the external flow is taken to be a plane,steady, supersonic flow, which makes a small angle with a planesurface or plane of symmetry, although the methods used can beextended to curved surfaces, to axially symmetric supersonicflows, and also to subsonic flows .  the internal dissipative flowis regarded as quasi-one-dimensional and parallel to the surfaceon the average, with a properly defined mean velocity and meantemperature .  the nonuniformity of the actual velocitydistribution is taken into account only approximately by means of arelation between mean temperature and mean velocity .mixing, or the transport of momentum from outer stream todissipative flow, is considered to be the fundamental physical processdetermining the pressure rise that can be supported by the flow .with the aid of this concept, a large number of flow problems isshown to be basically similar, such as boundary-layershockwave interaction, wake flow behind blunt-based bodies (basepressure problem), flow separation in overexpanded supersonicnozzles, separation on wings and bodies, etc .
