the problem of obtaining high lift-drag ratios at supersonic speeds .the importance of the lift to drag ratio is wellknown to all aircraft designers since it gives, to agreat extent, the aerodynamic efficiency of the airplane .aerodynamic efficiency, however, is only onecomponent of the grand compromise that a completedairplane represents .  at subsonic speeds, lift-dragratios of well over 200 have been measured in windtunnels on airfoil sections., but few powered aircrafthave attained (lift to drag ratio) value of 20 .  it is invariably truethat the requirements of stability and control, structure,and flight operation all contribute to reducing thedesign (lift to drag ratio) considerably below those exotic valueswhich can be predicted from unrestricted aerodynamictheory .  if, however, a certain range or operatingefficiency is required, there is most certainly a minimumif we examine the range equation we see that range isproportional to the lift-drag ratio, the thermopropulsiveefficiency, and the logarithm of the initial to finalweight ratio .  the appearance of the lift-drag ratio as alinear factor in the range equation indicates that everyattempt should be made to increase (lift to drag ratio)., however,the search for higher (lift to drag ratio) may lead to strangeand unorthodox configurations .  most frequently, suchconfigurations are ruled out by the adverse effects oftheir geometry on the weight ratios .  in the presentpaper, we will deal with the maximum lift-drag ratioproblem for conventional configurations having a wingand a body in close proximity to each other .  no attemptwill be made to select a particular configurationas being the best .  however, the promising directionto go from the aerodynamic view will be stressed withthe understanding that the other factors may outweightthe aerodynamics .
