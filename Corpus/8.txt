measurements of the effect of two-dimensional and three-dimensionalroughness elements on boundary layer transition .in his study of the effect of roughness on transition, h. l.dryden found, on the basis of available data, that the effectof a two-dimensional roughness element such as a /trip wire/could be represented reasonably well in terms of a functionalrelation between and, where is the reynolds numberof transition based on distance from the leading edge, is theheight of the roughness element, and is the boundary-layerdisplacement thickness at the position of the element .  at hissuggestion some additional data were obtained, primarily toextend the range to higher values of, during the course of aninvestigation of transition on a flat plate conducted at thenational bureau of standards .  after the results on the two-dimensional roughness elements were obtained, it appeared to bedesirable to see whether a row of three-dimensional roughnesselements would behave in the same way .
