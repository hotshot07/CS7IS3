flow about an unsteadily rotating disc .  an analysis is made of the unsteady laminar flow about arotating disc whose angular velocity may vary with time .the deviation of the actual instantaneous state of the flow fromthe quasi-steady state (instantaneous steady state) isdetermined .  from this, a simplified criterion, isderived to define the conditions under which the flow can beconsidered as quasi-steady for the purposes of shear stress andtorque computations .  since a turbulent flow responds morerapidly than a laminar flow, the quasi-steady criterion found hereshould also serve for the turbulent situation .
