laminar boundary layer oscillations and transitionon a flat plate .  this is an account of an investigation in which oscillationswere discovered in the laminar boundary layer along a flat plate .these oscillations were found during the course of an experimentin which transition from laminar to turbulent flow was beingstudied on the plate as the turbulence in the wind stream wasbeing reduced to unusually low values by means of dampingscreens .  the first part of the paper deals with experimentalmethods and apparatus, measurements of turbulence andsound, and studies of transition .  a description is then givenof the manner in which oscillations were discovered and howthey were found to be related to transition, and then howcontrolled oscillations were produced and studied in detail .  theoscillations are shown to be the velocity variationsaccompanying a wave motion in the boundary layer, this wave motion havingall the characteristics predicted by a stability theory based onthe exponential growth of small disturbances .  a review of thistheory is given .  the work is thus experimental confirmationof a mathematical theory of stability which had been in theprocess of development for a period of approximately 40 years,mainly by german investigators .
