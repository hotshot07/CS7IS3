a sensor for obtaining ablation rates .a variable-capacitance ablation-rate sensor which allows continuousmeasurements of ablation rates for teflon and similar polymers has beendeveloped and tested in an ethylene-heated high-temperature jet atstagnation temperatures ranging from 2,400degree to 3,800degree f .the data /length changes/ were measured by using the same telemeterequipment as that used in rocket-propelled flight vehicles . testresults indicate measurement error to be a maximum of 4 percent betweenthe telemetered length changes and the length changes that were obtained from photographic records of the test .
