the curtain jet .  a detailed analytic study is made of the curtain jet, thetwo-dimensional fluid wall used to contain support pressure on theunderside of ground effect machines .  two variations of the jetare studied in detail--the bifurcated jet, in which a portion of theflow streams into the support pressure region, and the deflectedjet, in which none of the flow penetrates into the support pressureregion .  kirchhoff-helmholtz free steamline analysis is usedto construct the flow field, and quantitative results are presentedfor the effect of nozzle inclination and detailed geometry on flowrequirements and support pressure differential at varyingaltitudes .
