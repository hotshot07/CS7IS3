stability of compressible boundary layers induced bya moving wave .  the problem of determining the stability of compressibleviscous flows with nonzero surface velocities is formulated and isshown to be identical to that for conventional boundary layers,with only a redefinition of the mach and reynolds numbersrequired .  specific consideration is given to the wall boundarylayer behind a moving shock wave, and the minimum criticalreynolds numbers are obtained for various shock velocities .the entire stability map is determined for the limiting case of aweak wave, which is analogous to the rayleigh problem .  the minimum critical reynolds number is found to increasemonotonically with shock velocity--i.e., with increasing surfacecooling and stream mach number combined .  for the ratio ofwall to stream velocity of 2.92 with (shock mach numberof 2.18) the flow is found to be infinitely stable to two-dimensionaldisturbances .  experimental transition data do not follow the trends predictedby the theory .  in fact, the transition reynolds numbers areorders of magnitude below the computed minimum criticalreynolds numbers .  the lack of correlation between theory andexperiment is attributed to disturbances which are external tothe boundary layer .
