stress and displacement analysis of simply supportednon- circular cylindrical shell under lateral pressure .this paper presents an analysis of the deflections of and stresses in ashort noncircular cylindrical shell of uniform wall thickness whosemedian-surface cross section is described analytically by a simpleexpression corresponding to a family of doubly symmetric ovals .  thecylinder is under a uniform lateral load and is simply supported at itsedges .  the small deflection analysis considered is based upon a seriessolution of appropriate differential equations of shell theory whichleads ultimately to infinite sets of algebraic equations, truncatedforms of which are considered .  numerical values of the significantstresses and displacements for points of the oval cylinder, which are 5percent of the axial length and 2.5 percent of the circumferentiallength apart, have been calculated for an oval cross section with amajor-minor axis ratio of 1.10 .
