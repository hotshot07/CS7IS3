formulae for use with the fatigue load meter in theassessment of wing fatigue life .  this note gives a method for the derivation of suitable constantswhich, when multiplied by the readings recorded at each appropriateacceleration level on a fatigue load meter and then added together, givedirectly the proportion of fatigue life used up in the wing .  it issuggested that when the estimated proportion is of order 80, then a moredetailed assessment of fatigue life should be made .
