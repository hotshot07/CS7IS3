the transonic flow of a compressible fluid throughan axially symmetrical nozzle .  by a method similar to that developed by s. tomotikaand k. tamada (quart. appl. math. 7, 381-397 (1950),.these rev. 11, 275) for computing two-dimensional mixedisentropic flows in the sonic region, the flow in the vicinityof the throat of an axially symmetrical nozzle is studied .several exact solutions to von karman's equation for axiallysymmetrical transonic flows are obtained and the one thatgives flows through a converging and diverging nozzle isconsidered in detail .  this solution consists of four branchesof which two are rejected because of singularities .  of theremaining two branches, one gives pure supersonic flow andthe other gives taylor's type of flow with a local supersonicregion in the throat .  by varying a parameter, the latterbranch approaches two asymptotes which yield meyer'stype of asymmetrical flows .
