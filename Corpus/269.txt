on a laminar free-convection flow and heat transferof electrically conducting fluid on a vertical flatplate in the presence of a transverse magnetic field .  the free-convection flow and heat transfer of anelectrically conducting fluid on avertical plate in the presence of a transverse magneticfield is analysed for a magnetic fieldfixed to the electrically non-conducting wall .  theboundary layer equations forself-preserving flows are integrated numerically for theprandtl number of unity, and the effectof the transverse magnetic field on the velocityprofile, temperature profile and rate ofheat transfer is discussed .  it is concluded thatthe heat transfer rate is reduced as themagnetic field intensity is increased .
