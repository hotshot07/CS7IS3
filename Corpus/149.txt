expansions at small reynolds number for the flow pasta sphere and a circular cylinder .  this paper is concerned with the problem of obtaining higherapproximations to the flow past a sphere and a circular cylinderthan those represented by the well-known solutions of stokesand oseen .  since the perturbation theory arising from theconsideration of small non-zero reynolds numbers is a singularone, the problem is largely that of devising suitable techniques fortaking this singularity into account when expanding the solutionfor small reynolds numbers .  the technique adopted is as follows .  separate, locally validthe regions close to, and far from, the obstacle .  reasons arepresented for believing that these 'stokes' and 'oseen' expansionsare, respectively, of the formswhere are spherical or cylindrical polar coordinates madedimensionless with the radius of the obstacle, r is the reynoldsnumber, and and vanish with r .  substitutionof these expansions in the navier-stokes equation then yields aset of differential equations for the coefficients and, butonly one set of physical boundary conditions is applicable to eachexpansion (the no-slip conditions for the stokes expansion, andthe uniform-stream condition for the oseen expansion) so thatunique solutions cannot be derived immediately .  however, thefact that the two expansions are (in principle) both derived fromthe same exact solution leads to a 'matching' procedure whichyields further boundary conditions for each expansion .  it is thuspossible to determine alternately successive terms in eachexpansion .  the leading terms of the expansions are shown to be closelyrelated to the original solutions of stokes and oseen, and detailedresults for some further terms are obtained .
