reduction of the clamped plate to two membrane problemswith an application to uniformly loaded sectors .  the clamped plate problem inthe classical theory for the smalldeflection bending of flat platesis reduced to the solution by variationalmethods of two successive membraneproblems .  the first requires the leastsquare minimisation of the averagecurvature of the deflected surface whilethe second problem concerns theintegral of the gaussian curvature .  thereis a similar reduction for extensionalproblems where the boundary tractionsare specified .  the method is demonstrated bygiving three distinct solutions to theproblem of the clamped sector undera uniformly distributed load .  onesolution is of special interest becauseit is derived from a single membraneproblem .  numerical data are given .
