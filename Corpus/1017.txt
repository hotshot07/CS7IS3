note on creep buckling of columns .it appears from librove's interesting analysis that, forthe case of creep buckling of columns, the initialimperfections contained in ordinary columns provide the mechanism bywhich failure due to creep occurs after a period of time .  in fact,it can be concluded from this analysis that a theoretically perfectcolumn that is initially loaded below the time-independent criticalload will not buckle at all .  this is an interesting contrast to thecase of static buckling where small initial imperfections play aninsignificant role, since the failing load of an initially imperfectcolumn is substantially the same as that of a theoretically perfectcolumn .  it is of interest, therefore, to conjecture whether there isany possible mechanism by which a column containing no initialimperfections can fail as a result of creep when the initial load isless than the theoretical buckling load .
