qualitiative solutions of the stability equation for a boundary layer in contact with various forms of flexible surface .an appropriate form of the boundary layer stability equation isdeveloped for the condition where the fluid is in contact with anisotropic and homogeneous elastic medium, and various approximateanalytical solutions obtained for certain types of surface, so as to reveal atleast qualitatively the origin and characteristics of neutraloscillations . in the worked solutions the elastic medium is treated asnondissipative, and the interior boundary is supposed either fixed, or free of stress, or exposed to fluid .. the boundary layer, also, is treatedas that over a flat-plate in an incompressible fluid .the results obtained show that the presence of such a resiliant surfaceintroduces the possibility of a number of other modes of oscillationschlichting waves . most of these modes have speeds of propagationdetermined largely by the properties of the elastic material, and theirpresence may well be effectively a matter of 'non-viscous' flowstability -dash a subject not treated here . the tollmien-schlichtingmode has its minimum reynolds number increased by the presence of thesurface, but if the interior boundary is free there may be an upperlimit as well . indeed, a sufficiently thin free surface, or one of lowrigidity, apparently eliminates neutral oscillations of this modealtogether, only at the expense, however, of the introduction of a mode offlexural waves .
