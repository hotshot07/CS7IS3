laminar mixing of a non-uniform stream with a fluidat rest .  a theoretical analysis is made of the constant pressurelaminar mixing process between a stream having an initial boundary layervelocity profile, and a fluid at rest .  the present theory follows the methods of w. tollmien ands. i. pai with certain modifications .the results apply to incompressibleflow, but can be extended to the compressible case without difficulty .
