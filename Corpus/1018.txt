note on creep buckling of columns .





note on creep buckling of columns .  the results of short-time elevated-temperature creep tests ofobjective of obtaining procedures for predicting column lifetime .semiempirical lifetime curves are obtained with the aid of a previouslypublished column creep theory and are used for deriving column curves .the semiempirical lifetime curves are also used to study the effect ofvarying applied stress and out-of-straightness .  in the rangeconsidered, small variations in out-of-straightness are found to be oflittle practical significance,. whereas, small stress variations changethe column lifetime considerably .  for the range of out-of-straightnessencountered in the tests, the data can be presented in plots that do notexplicitly include out-of-straightness, and plots of this type should besatisfactory for predicting column lifetime for design purposes .
