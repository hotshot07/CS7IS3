tumbling bodies entering the atmosphere .the equations of motion of a tumbling flat plate entering an exponential atmosphere were linearized and solved analytically to obtain a simpleexpression for the altitude at which tumbling would cease and librationwould commence . the plate had only three degrees of freedom, andaerodynamic forces were derived from newtonian impact theory . in thelinear analysis, mean values of the drag and pitch damping coefficientsso that flutter occurs in the range of a low-speed wind tunnel .a particular type of construction for supersonic flutter models isdescribed in detail . methods of vibration testing, static testing, andflutter testing are discussed . particular emphasis is placed on thetechnique of varying flow parameters rather than model parameters toprecipitate flutter . the tool for varying flow parameters is thevariable mach number supersonic test section of the massachusettsinstitute of technology blowdown wind tunnel . the aerodynamic features of the supersonic test section are presented .
