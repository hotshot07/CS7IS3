heat transfer to a hemisphere-cylinder at low reynoldsnumbers .  measurements of the local heat flux tohemisphere-cylinder models in a supersonic rarefiedair stream are presented .  two different steady-statemethods were developed, and fiveindividual models were used .  data were obtainedthroughout the mach number range of 2 to 6,with reynolds numbers (based on conditionsbehind the bow shock and model diameter)varying from 38 to 1730 .  the stagnation point dataindicated a gradual increase from continuumboundary layer theory at the higher reynoldsnumbers to about 10 above at the lower endof the range investigated .  pressure distributionmeasurements on cooled and uncooled modelswere found to agree well with modified newtoniantheory .  local recovery factormeasurements showed a small rarefaction effect at thelowest reynolds numbers .
