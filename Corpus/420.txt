an experimental study of the flow field about swept and delta wingswith sharp leading edges .a series of experiments was performed to define the flow field on theupper surface of high aspect ratio swept wings and narrow delta wings at high angles of attack .it was found that near the root section of either type of wing the flowis conical . the edge of the vortex sheet which originates at theleading edge is a straight line whose position relative to the leading edgedepends only on incidence . on swept wings, the vortex edge turnsdown-stream as soon as the vortex sheet covers the front half of the wingchord, and the flow under the vortex sheet outboard of that turningpoint is uniform and parallel to the leading edge of the wing . onnarrow delta wings, the conical symmetry persists almost to the trailingedge .
