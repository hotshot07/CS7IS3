design and calibration at low speeds of a static tubeand a pitot-static tube with semi-ellipsoidal noseshapes .  a new static tube and a new pitot-static tube have been designed andcalibrated in the no.1 and the no.2 11 ft x 8 ft wind tunnels of ther.a.e., using a long static tube, the error of which is believed to bevery small, as a standard for comparison .  the results show that the static pressure measured by these tubesis in error due to the supporting strut and to the nose shape of thetube by an amount which may be calculated for positions of the staticslot, or holes, greater than 10 tube diameters ahead of the strut .  thereadings show no measurable scale effect in the speed range 100-230 ftsec .  the static tube is insensitive to yaw in the range 1 with asquare-edged slot and is even less sensitive to yaw when the slot edgesare rounded .  the turbulence of the tunnel has an effect on the staticpressure reading .
