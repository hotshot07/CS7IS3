pressure measurements on sharp and blunt 5 and 15 half-anglecones at mach number 3.86 and angles of attack to100 .  measured pressure distributions on cones are compared with modifiednewtonian theory .  deviations as large as 14 percent of the stagnationpressure behind a normal shock are found .by combining empirical resultsfor cylinders normal to the flow withnewtonian concepts, a method ofcalculating pressures on cones at high anglesof attack is developed .calculations by this method differ from theexperimental results on sharp conesby only 2 percent of the stagnationpressure behind a normal shock .  forblunted cones, additional deviationsup to 8 percent are noted near thenose .  schlieren pictures of the flow show an attached shock on the sharpof attack .  detachment of the shockappears to be associated with theattainment of sonic speed immediatelybehind the shock .  an orifice size effect is found which can increase the indicatedpressure above the true value, ifthe orifice width is greater thanone-tenth the local radius of curvature .
