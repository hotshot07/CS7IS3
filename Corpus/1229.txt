the effect of sweep angle on hypersonic flow over bluntwings .  a series of tests were carried out in the princeton universityhelium hypersoule wind tunnel on blunt two-dimensional wingsat zero angle of attack with sweep angles up to 70 at machnumbers from 7 to 15 .  the leading edge reynolds number variedfrom 3,000 to 25,000 .  the measured pressure distributions werecompared with the simple summation of the theoretical inviscideffect (based on blast wave theory using the normal machnumber) added to the viscous effect (calculated as if no sweepwere present) .  for the unswept wing, the slope of the pressuredecay was reasonably well predicted by the theoreticalcalculations .  the viscous theory reasonably predicted the variation inthe pressure distribution due to changes in leading-edgereynolds number .  by subtracting the theoretical viscous effects, aninviscid mach number dependence of the 2.2 power was foundas compared to the value of 2.0 predicted by the inviscid theory .the same approach for the swept wing did not give consistentlysatisfactory results .  deviations avove and below the calculatedvalue by as much as 40-50 percent were measured and thereseemed to be no systematic variation with either mach number orreynolds number .  at a constant high reynolds number, it wasfound that the pressure distribution varied with the distancealong the wing with an exponent between about--0.53 and--0.58except for a rather sharp decrease which occurred for the 70sweep case .  the pressure at a given station for a fixed machnumber and given leading edge thickness varied as the cosine ofthe sweep angle to the 1.1 power as compared to the 1.3 powerpredicted from general geometrical considerations .
