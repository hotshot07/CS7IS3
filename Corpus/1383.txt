on the theory of laminar boundary layer involving separation .  the paper presents a mathematical discussion of thelaminar boundary layer, which was developed with a viewof facilitating the investigation of those boundary layersin particular for which the phenomenon of separationoccurs .  the treatment starts with a slight modification ofthe form of the boundary layer equation first published byvon mises .  two approximate solutions of this equationare found, one of which is exact at the outer edge of theboundary layer while the other is exact at the wall .  thefinal solution is obtained by joining these two solutionsat the inflection points of the velocity profiles .  the finalsolution is given in terms of a series of universal functionsfor a fairly broad class of potential velocity distributionsoutside of the boundary layer .  detailed calculations ofthe boundary layer characteristics are worked out for thecase in which the potential velocity is a linear function ofthe distance from the upstream stagnation point .  finallythe complete separation point characteristics aredetermined for the boundary layer associated with a potentialvelocity distribution made up of two linear functions ofthe distance from the stagnation point .  it appears thatextensions of the detailed calculations to more complexpotential flows can be fairly easily carried out by usingthe explicit formulae given in the paper .
