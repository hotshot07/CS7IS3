one dimensional flows of an imperfect diatomic gas .  with the assumptions that berthelot's equation of stateaccounts for molecular size and intermolecular force effects, andthat changes in the vibrational heat capacities are given by aplanck term, expressions are developed for analyzingone-dimensional flows of a diatomic gas .  the special cases of flow through normal and oblique shocksin free air at sea level are investigated .  it is found that up to amach number of 10 the pressure ratio across a normal shockdiffers by less than 6 percent from its ideal gas value,. whereasat mach numbers above 4 the temperature rise is considerablybelow and hence the density rise is well above that predictedassuming ideal gas behavior .  it is further shown that only thecaloric imperfection in air has an appreciable effect on thepressures developed in the shock process considered .  the effectsof gaseous imperfections on oblique shock flows are studied fromthe standpoint of their influence on the lift and pressure dragof a flat plate operating at mach numbers of 10 and 20 .  theinfluence is found to be small .
