two dimensional transonic unsteady flow with shockwaves .  a study is made of the unsteady flow around anairfoil at transonic mach numbers, the situation beingsuch that local supersonic regions terminated byshock-waves are present in the vicinity of the airfoil .  forthe unsteady part of the flow, small perturbationstechnique is employed and the interaction with the shockwave is taken into account .  the case of an oscillatingaileron is considered first, and a solution is derivedfor the pressure distribution on the aileron .  it isfound that the solution has a simple form when theshock-wave is well ahead of the hinge axis of theaileron .  as the shock approaches the hinge-axis acorrection must be added to the solution .  aninterpretation of these results is given .  the results arecompared with results of a theory which neglects thepresence of the shock and it is found that both agreefor m = 1 .  for m   1, however, neglecting the presenceof the shock waves introduces errors of the order ofmagnitude (1 - m), where m is the local mach numberbehind the shock .  the theory is finally extended to include the casein which the whole airfoil oscillates, but only thesolution for the subsonic region behind the shock istreated .  the role of the unsteady shock-boundary layerinteraction is discussed and it is shown that thismechanism can be included in the results of the presenttheory .
