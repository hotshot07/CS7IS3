note on an interaction between the boundary layer and the inviscidflow .according to the classical boundary-layer theory the flow about bodiesat reynolds numbers of aeronautical interest can be considered ascomposed of two regimes..  an outside inviscid flow and a thinboundary-layer region adjacent to the body .  this point of view leads to theapproximation that, on a slightly curved surface, throughout the layeris negligibly small .  the additional assumption that the inviscid flowis irrotational leads to the requirement that is zero at the outer edgeof the boundary layer .  in this theory any interaction between the tworegimes is accountable by a simple correction to the body shape based onthe boundary-layer displacement thickness .recently, in connection with hypersonic laminar boundary layers, thisclassical point of view has been modified., an interaction between thetwo flow regimes leading to a self-induced axial pressure gradient hasbeen considered .  it is the purpose of the present note to point outanother type of interaction which may be of practical importance and offundamental interest even at mach numbers below those considered in thehypersonic boundary-layer theory and which may have to be considered inthat theory .
