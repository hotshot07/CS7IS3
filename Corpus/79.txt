effects of extreme surface cooling on boundary layertransition .  an investigation was made to determine the combined effects ofsurface cooling, pressure gradients, nose blunting, and surface finish onboundary-layer transition .  data were obtained for various body shapesat a mach number of 3.12 and reynoldsnumbers per foot as high as 15x10 .  previous transition studies, with moderate cooling, have shownagreement with the predictions of stability theory .  for surface roughnessesranging from 4 to 1250 microinches the location of transition wasunaffected with moderate cooling .  with extreme cooling, an adverse effectwas observed for each of the parameters investigated .  in general, thetransition reynolds number decreased withdecreasing surface temperature .in particular, the beneficial effects of a favorable pressure gradientobtained with moderate cooling disappear with extreme cooling, and atransition reynolds number lower thanthat observed on a cone is obtained .further, an increase in the nose bluntness decreased the transitionreynolds number under conditions of extreme cooling .
