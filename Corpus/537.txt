stagnation point viscous hypersonic flow .several methods have been developed for computing thehypersonic, low reynolds number flow in the stagnationregion of a blunt body .  in general, these methods involvecomplicated numerical solutions .  simultaneous iterations on severalparameters are usually required in view of the boundary-valuenature of the problem .  the purpose of this note is to present an approximateclosed-form solution to axisymmetric stagnation point hypersonic flowin the viscous layer regime .
