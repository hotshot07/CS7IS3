pressure distribution induced on a flat plate at a free-streammach number of 1.39 by rockets exhausting upstream and downstream .an experimental investigation was made of the pressures induced ona flat plate at a free-stream mach number of 1.39 by a supersonicrocket jet exhausting upstream and downstream .  measurements of thepressure distribution on a flat plate were made at zero angle ofattack for 11 different locations of the jet exhaust nozzle beneaththe wing .  measurements were made at ratios of rocket-exit totalpressure to free-stream static pressure from 6 to 60 and at a reynoldsnumber per foot of approximately 10 times 10 to the power of 6 .  therocket when exhausted upstream produced a strong shock that movedfurther upstream with increasing rocket-exit total-pressure ratio .positive incremental normal-force coefficients were obtained at all testpositions .  data at 11 test positions are tabulated for rocket-onand rocket-off pressure coefficients as well as for incremental pressurecoefficients for the 48 orifices of the flat plate for the range ofratio of rocket-exit total pressure to free-stream static pressureof the investigation .  changing the location of the model withrespect to the plate had a negligible effect when the rocket wasvaried in the chordwise direction, but the pressure coefficientswere reduced as the rocket was lowered away from the flat-plate wing .
