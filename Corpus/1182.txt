an approximate solution for laminar boundary layer flow .this paper presents an approximate solution for two-dimensional,incompressible, laminar boundary layer flow with arbitrary pressuregradient . von mises' form of the boundary layer equation is linearizedby making a change in the coefficient of one of the terms .  thelinearized equation yields a solution that is accurate for the outer portionof the flow but inaccurate near the surface .  a separate inner solutionthen is developed which is accurate at the surface and which joins withthe outer solution at some point within the boundary layer .  themethod may be considered a major modification of one developed earlierby von karman and millikan, with changes in both outer and innersolutions, and the point at which the two solutions are joined .  the changesimprove the accuracy of the method and in some respects simplify thecalculations .  as examples, results are presented for flow with alinear variation of velocity (including flat plate and stagnationpoint flow as special cases), flow with sinusoidal variation ofvelocity, flow past a circular cylinder (heimenz' velocitydistribution), and flow past an ellipse (schubauer's data) . agreementwith theoretically exact solutions is good, and better thanresults obtained using the pohlhausen method .
