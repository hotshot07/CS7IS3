non-equilibrium flow of an ideal dissociating gas .the theory of an'ideal dissociating'gas developed by lighthill/1957/forconditions of thermodynamic equilibrium is extended to non-equilibriumconditions by postulating a simple rate equation for the dissociationprocess/including the effects of recombination/ . this equation contains the'equilibrium'parameters of the lighthill theory plus a furtherdissociation phenomena .the behaviour of this gas is investigated in flow through a strongnormal shock wave and past a bluff body . the assumption is made thatthe gas receives complete excitation of its rotational and vibrationaldegrees of freedom in an infinitesimally thin region according to thefamiliar rankine-hugoniot shock wave relations before dissociationbegins . the variation of the relevant thermodynamic variablesdown-stream of this region is then computed in a few particular cases . themethod used in the latter case is an extension of the'newtonian'theoryof hypersonic inviscid flow . in particular, the case of a sphere istreated in some detail . the variation of the shock shape and thesphere diameter to the length scale of the dissociation process, isexhibited for conditions extending from completely undissociated flowto dissociated flow in thermal equilibrium . results would indicatethat significant and observable changes from the undissociated valuesoccur, although values for the non-equilibrium parameter are not, atpresent, available .
