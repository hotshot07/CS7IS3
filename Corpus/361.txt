the flow of a viscous liquid past a flat plate at smallreynolds number .  the authors repeat the earlier calculations of piercyand winny (proc. roy. soc. london. ser. a. 140 (1933),earlier works were known to be different from each other .the careful analysis of the present authors shows that theskin-friction coefficient up to the second approximationagrees perfectly with that of piercy and winny .
