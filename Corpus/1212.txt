effect of uniformly distributed roughness on turbulentskin-friction drag at supersonic speeds .  an experimental program was carried out in the 18-in. by20-in. supersonic wind tunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory todetermine the effect of uniformly distributed sand-grainroughness on the skin-friction drag of a body of revolution for the caseof a turbulent boundary layer .  the mach number rangecovered was 1.98 to 4.54, and the reynolds number varied fromabout 3 x 10 to 8 x 10 .  some data were also obtained at amach number of 0.70 .  at speeds up to a mach number of 5 and for roughness sizessuch that the quadratic resistance law holds, the compressibilityeffect is indirect, and the skin-friction drag is a function of onlythe roughness reynolds number, exactly as in theincompressible case .  it is shown that the entire compressibility effectis a reduction of the fluid density at the surface as the machnumber increases .  the critical roughness, below which thesurface is hydraulically smooth, is,. this is equalto the thickness of the laminar sublayer for a smooth surface forboth compressible and incompressible flow .  over the range ofroughness sizes considered here, there appears to be no wave dragassociated with the drag due to roughness .  the shift in theturbulent veocity profile for a rough surface at supersonicspeeds is a function of only the roughness reynolds numberand quantitatively follows exactly the same law as thatfor the incompressible case .
