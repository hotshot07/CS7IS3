on flutter testing in high speed wind tunnels .  the requirements for simulating in a wind tunnel flutter conditionsappropriate to high-speed flight are discussed, and an assessment ismade of the desirable features of a wind tunnel suitable for fluttertesting at transonic and supersonic speeds .  it is concluded that such a tunnel should have either the mach numberor the stagnation pressure variable during the tunnel run, and that itis of considerable advantage, and for some purposes essential, for highstagnation pressures to be available .  the stagnation pressure requiredto allow flight conditions to be simulated with a flutter model isconsidered to range from at least 2 atmospheres for transonic speeds toabout 15 atmospheres for m = 4 .  no attempt to simulate kinetic heatingis envisaged, although its effect on stiffness should be allowed for inthe design of the model .  to minimise uncertainties due to thevariation of the model stiffness with temperature it is desirable thatmeans for controlling the stagnation temperature should be incorporatedin the tunnel .
