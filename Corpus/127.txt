supersonic axially symmetric nozzles .  at each of twenty-one exit mach numbers, rangingfrom 1.008 to 8.238, ten supersonic axially symmetricnozzle shapes with plane sonic surfaces have been computedon the eniac by the method of characteristics .  theboundary of the shortest of each group of ten has asharp edge at the sonic plane, while the others havesmooth boundaries .  this report describes the computationalprocedures and presents a sample of the results for twentynozzles .  more extensive and elaborate tables of the results of theentire computations are available at the ballisticresearch laboratories .  nozzle contours can be obtainedaccurately from them by interpolation for exit mach numbersbetween 1.479 and 8.238 for a wide range of ratios of nozzlelength to throat diameter .
