the aerodynamic effects of aspect ratio and sweepbackon wing flutter .  the report describes tests to obtain directmeasurements of the aerodynamic effects of aspect ratio andsweepback on wing flutter .  the tests were made on rigidwings with root flexibilities .  it is shown that measured effects of aspect ratio andsweepback on the flutter of these wings can be representedquite closely in flutter calculations based on two-dimensionalflow theory by multiplying the two-dimensionalaerodynamic coefficients by appropriate factors .  the effect ofsweepback is represented by multiplying all aerodynamiccoefficients by cos, where is the wing leading-edgesweepback, and the effect of aspect ratio is represented bymultiplying the aerodynamic damping coefficients by 1f(a) and,the stiffness coefficients by 1(f(a)) where a is theaspect ratio .  for the wings tested an average value forf(a) is f(a) = (1 + (0.8a)) .
