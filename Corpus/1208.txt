a linearized analysis of the forces exerted on a rigidwing by a shock wave .  solutions are obtained in closed form for the pressures exertedon a rigid half plane by an incident, plane acoustic shock wave .the angle of incidence of the wave front is arbitrary and the halfplane is considered to be traveling at constant velocity, subsonicof supersonic with respect to the acoustic medium .  aclosed-form solution is obtained also for a rigid wedge which ismotionless with respect to the acoustic medium .  the analysis is carriedout by transforming the wave equation to laplace's equationby the busemann conical transformation and then applyingconformal mapping .
