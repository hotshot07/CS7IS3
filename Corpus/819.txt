stresses in the plastic range around a normally loadedcircular hole in an infinite sheet .the stresses in the plastic range around a normally loaded circular holein an infinite sheet are found numerically on the basis of bothdeformation and incremental theories .  the results of deformationtheory are quantitatively assessed in the light of a criterion, recentlydeveloped by budiansky, for the acceptability of deformation theories .the criterion is completely satisfied .  moreover, the results obtainedby using these two different theories of plasticity do not differgreatly despite the fact that the stress paths are far from beingradial .
