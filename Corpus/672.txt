wind tunnel techniques, chapter 8 pitman. 1952 .

tunnel interference effects .the problems of solid blockage, wake blockage, lift effect, and theinfluence of boundary constraint at high mach number are considered indetail . corrections are given for various open and closed tunnels,rectangular, circular and octagonal, and different speeds, two andthree dimensional flows, with several aerofoils and wings . otherinterferences include the wall boundary layer, gradient of staticpressure and problems with the working fluid used .
