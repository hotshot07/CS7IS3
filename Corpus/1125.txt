collapse by instability of thin cylindrical shellsunder external pressure .  this paper discusses the collapse by instability ofthin-walled cylindrical vessels subjected to external pressure .the most important of the theoretical and empiricalformulas that apply to this subject are presented in acommon notation .  a new and simple instability formula isdeveloped .  three classes of tubes are considered ..  tubes of infinitelength,. tubes of finite length with uniform radialpressure only,. and tubes of finite length with both uniformradial and axial pressure .  collapsing pressurescalculated by the various formulas are presented in tabularform as a means of comparing the formulas .  the formulas are discussed briefly and checked againstthe results of tests conducted at the u. s. experimentalmodel basin for the bureau of construction and repair,navy department .  this paper is a sequel to one previously published as apart of the work of the a.s.m.e. special researchcommittee on the strength of vessels under external pressure .
