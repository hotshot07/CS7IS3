on alternative forms for the basic equations of transonic
flow theory .
attention has been called by numerous authors to the
possibility of certain alternative forms for the equations for
transonic flow about thin wings .  it is the purpose of this note
to contribute to this discussion and to indicate some reasons for
the selection of one form of these in preference to another more
widely used form .
