inelastic column theory .  the action of a column in the plastic range is analyzed on thebasis that bending may proceed simultaneously with increasingaxial load .  this leads to a new column formula that includesboth the tangent-modulus (engesser) and the reduced-modulusthe tangent-modulus load and that the column load increaseswith increasing lateral deflection, approaching thereduced-modulus load as a limit if the tangent modulus is assumed toremain constant .
