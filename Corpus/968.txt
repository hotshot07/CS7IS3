rocket propulsion systems for interplanetary flight .a comparison is made of several different propulsion systems forinterplanetary flight . liquid and solid propellant rockets, propulsionsystems which use nuclear energy sources, are heating rockets,magneto-plasma devices, ion rocket propulsion, solar heating rockets, and solarsails are briefly described and their current status reviewed . engineperformance requirements for different interplanetary missions areestablished . these several propulsion systems are then compared on thebasis of several performance criteria, environmental characteristics,vehicle requirements, reliability, current status, growth potential, and efficiency . predictions on various propulsion system capabilities andan analysis of multiple rocket engine reliability is included . it isconcluded that electrical rockets are superior for long-timeinter-planetary flight applications, and that chemical rockets aresatisfactory for most of the immediate applications in /near/ space . none of the several propulsion schemes discussed can be rejected until furthertechnical work has been accomplished .
