numerical determination of indical lift and moment functions for a twodimensional sinking and pitching airfoil at mach numbers 0.5 and 0.6 .the indicial lift and moment functions are determined approximately forsinking and pitching motion at mach numbers m of 0.5 and 0.6 . thesefunctions are determined from a knowledge of the existing oscillatorycoefficients at the low reduced frequencies and from approximateexpressions of these coefficients at the high reduced frequencies .the beginning portion of the indicial lift function associated with anairfoil penetrating a sharp-edge gust in subsonic flow is evaluated byuse of an exact method . by use of an approximate method for determining the remaining portion, the complete indicial gust function isdetermined for m 0.5, m 0.6, and m 0.7 .all the indicial lift and moment functions are approximated by anexponential series,. the coefficients which appear in the exponentialapproximations for each indicial function are tabulated for m 0.5,m 0.6, and m 0.7 .
