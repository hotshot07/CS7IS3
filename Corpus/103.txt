theory of mixing and chemical reaction in the opposedjet diffusion flame .  an idealization of the flow system used by potterand butler is analyzed .  the differentialequation of mixing is solved exactly, to give the locationof, and burning rate in, the flame .  the solutionsto the chemical kinetic differential equationare discussed, relations being derived between the jetflow rate at extinction, the chemical kineticconstants and the laminar flame speed in premixedgases .  it is shown that the jet flow rate atextinction is independent of the transport properties .comparison is made with the experimentaldata of potter, heimel and butler .  it is argued thatexperiments must be carried out at higherreynolds numbers if the measurements are to bequantitatively analyzable .
