numerical technique to lifting surface theory for calculationof unsteady aerodynamic forces due to continuous sinusoidalgusts on several wing planforms at sobsonic speeds .  a numerical lifting-surface method hasbeen used to calculate direct gustforces and moments on wings of severalplanforms .  the gust velocities arecontinuous and vary sinusoidally in the streamdirection and are also uniform acrossthe wing span .  the procedure has theadvantage of rapid machine calculation andincludes the effects of wing planform,nonsteady subsonic flow, and induced floweffects .  the method provides for calculationof gust forces on a basisconsistent with that for the calculation of forcesdue to motion and deformation .  theresults include the in-phase and quadraturecomponents of the followingquantities ..  (a) spanwise distribution ofsection lift coefficient, (b) totallift coefficient, and (c) total pitching-momentcoefficient .  in addition,generalized gust forces on approximate fundamentalcantilever bending modes (parabolic) are also included .  results have beenobtained for 60 and 75 delta wings,ratio 11.60, and an unswept wing of aspectratio 6.00 .  conditions for whichcalculations were made include two mach numbersreduced-frequency range of 0 to 1.0 .  thedirect gust forces and moments are informs suitable to be inserted in equationsof motion used in the calculation ofthe dynamic responses of flexible liftingvehicles to random turbulence and to becompared with results from other methods .
