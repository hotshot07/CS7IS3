the uniform section disk spring .  the authors point out in this paper that initially conedannular-disk springs of uniform cross section may beproportioned to give a wide variety of load-deflectioncurves not readily obtainable with the more conventionalforms of springs, and that, although the versatility of thistype spring has long been indicated, the formulasavailable have not been presented in a manner to disclosereadily the effect of spring proportions on characteristics .therefore the authors have derived the formulas presentedin this paper with the intention that the formulas will aidthe designer in arriving at suitable characteristics bychoice of spring geometry .  these new formulas havebeen in use for several years at the general motorscorporation research laboratories section, and theirreliability has been checked by tests of springs used in avariety of special test equipment .
