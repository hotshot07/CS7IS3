the drag of elongated bodies over a wide reynolds numberrange .  the resistance of bodies in motion through an incompressibleviscous fluid is predictable from stokes- or oseen-type solutionsin the creeping-motion range, while some test information isavailable in the boundary-layer range .  with the exception ofexperimental results for spheres or circular cylinders andanalytical and experimental results for flat plates, almost no informationis available on other bodies, particularly in the intermediaterange of reynolds numbers extending from unity to a million .  experimental results as obtained from hydroballistic studiesin water and glycerin-water solutions are presented for finnedellipsoids of fineness-ratio .4 over a 20,000-fold range and arecorrelated with available information on other bodies .  althoughresults do not extend down to the creeping-motion region whereanalytical predictions are available, comparison with the dragcoefficient trends for spheres and flat plates indicates that anappropriate curve for the ellipsoid could be extended so as to coverthe entire laminar-viscous range .  less extensive results arepresented on the drag of fineness-ratio 8 ellipsoids and onlaminar-turbulent transition occurrences .
