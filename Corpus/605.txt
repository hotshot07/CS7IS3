pressure measurements on a cone-cylinder-flare configuration at smallincidences for m 6.8 .pressure measurements were made on a slender cone-cylinder-flareconfiguration, slightly blunted at the nose, for 0, 3 and 6 degreesincidence at a free-stream mach number of 6.8 .it was found that the surface pressures obtained on the cone agreed with extrapolations to m equals 6.8 of theoretical values given in m.i.t.tables /kopal/for yawed cones, and that impact theory gave a goodindication of the pressure level to be expected on all parts of the bodywhere surface incidence was sufficiently large to merit its use .the semi-angles of the conical and flared parts of the model were boththe pressure level on the flare rose in all cases to approximately thatdeveloped upstream on the cone surface .no evidence of a marked over-expansion to pressures below thefree-stream value was noticed at the junction between cone and cylinder .
