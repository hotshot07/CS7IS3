experimental investigation of the effect of yaw onrates of heat transfer to transverse circularcylinders in a 6500-foot-per-secondhypersonic air stream .a technique has been developed by which air can be shock-compressedby helium to 3660 degrees rankine to generate a 6500-foot-per-secondair stream with a flow duration of 40 milliseconds .  the resultingequipment is described .  experiments were conducted to determinerates of heat transfer to transverse circular cylinders of 0.003-,greater than 100 .  the cylinders were tested at a nominal mach numberof 11 with a stagnation reynolds number (evaluated with free-streammass flow and stagnation viscosity of 4.00 times 10 to the 4th powerper foot .
