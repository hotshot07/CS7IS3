method of controlling stiffness properties of a solid-constructionmodel wing .a simple method is presented for controlling the bending and torsionalstiffnesses of a solid-construction model wing . the method consists ofweakening the wing by drilling holes through the wing normal to thechord plane . aerodynamic continuity is maintained by filling the holeswith a relatively soft material . the important parameters controllingthe stiffnesses are the amount of material removed by drilling, theratio of hole diameter to wing thickness, and the plan-form pattern ofthe holes . data are given which may be used for predicting thestiffness of a model wing weakened in this manner .
