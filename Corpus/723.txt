on the fatigue failure of structures due to vibrations excitedby random pressure fields .on the assumption that the forced modes of vibration of a structure,subjected to pressure fluctuations random in time and space, can beapproximated by the composition of the motions of the uncouplednatural modes, a general analysis is made using the ideas of vibrationtheory and spectrum analysis .  the power spectrum, and hence therms value, of any quantity depending linearly upon structuraldistortions is derived and it involves a quantity (called the /jointacceptance/) concerning the spacewise structure of the pressurefield and of the geometry of the modes of vibration .  it is shown howthis result may be used (on assuming /normal/ randomness) to estimatethe fatigue life on the hypothesis of cumulative damage .
