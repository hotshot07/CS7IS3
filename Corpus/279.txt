supersonic drag calculations for a cylindrical shellwing of semicircular cross section combined with acentral body of revolution .  a semi-circular ring wing with a body of revolution onthe axis is studied to find the wave and the vortex drag forvarious chordwise lift distributions and for three values ofa parameter describing the wing geometry .  using thewave drag obtained from the chordwise loading that gives theleast drag, together with the vortex and skin friction drags,the maximum lift to drag ratio for each wing geometry iscomputed .  compared to the estimates made by lomax andheaslet, somewhat lower drags are found .
