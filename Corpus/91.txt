periodic temperature distribution in a two-layer composite slab .in a recent contribution to the reader's forum, under the above title,stonecypher outlined a method for finding the periodic temperaturedistribution in a two-layer composite slab, one exposed surface of the slabbeing insulated and the other subject to a sinusoidal temperaturevariation .  perfect thermal contact between the two layers, and constantthermal properties were assumed .two years ago i drew attention in these pages to a method fordetermining the transient temperature in such a two-layer slab resulting from atriangular heat-input pulse .  i should like to point out that this samemethod also is applicable to the case where one external face is givena sinusoidal temperature variation with time .  the method is based onthe analogy between one-dimensional heat flow and the flow of anelectric current in a simple transmission line having only series resistanceand parallel capacitance .
