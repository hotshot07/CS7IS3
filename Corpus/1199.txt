theoretical investigations of a supersonic laminarboundary layer with foreign-gas injection .  the phenomena arising from the uniform injection of helium,air, argon, and iodine into the laminar boundary layer of asupersonic stream of air in a tube were investigated theoretically .the partial differential equations describing the energy, mass,and momentum transfers through the boundary layer wereobtained, and a series solution was found for the case of uniforminjection through the tube wall .  the results of the analysis arein the form of axial distributions of wall temperature andrecovery factor and of radial distribution of concentration,velocity, static, and stagnation temperatures .  the gas mixturewas assumed to be a perfect gas .  properties of the mixture werecalculated in accordance with the gibbs-dalton rule and themixing rules based on the kinetic theory of dilute gases .transport properties for pure air were taken from the n.b.s.tabulations .  transport properties for the other gases were calculatedby kinetic-theory methods, employing a lennard-jones 6-12model for the interaction potential .  the theoretical predictionsfor the recovery factor along the tube with air or argon injectionagree with experimental data to within one percent .  thetheoretical predictions for helium injection indicate an 8-percentrise in the recovery factor along the tube, while experimentshave shown only a 1-percent rise .  these differences betweentheory and experiment are attributed to inaccuracies in theapproximations to the transport properties of the binary mixtures .
