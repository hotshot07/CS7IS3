an approximate solution of the supersonic blunt bodyproblem for prescribed arbitrary axisymmetric shapes .  the integral method of belotserkovskii has been carried out tothe first approximation for arbitrary blunt axisymmetric bodiesin supersonic or hypersonic flight .  this method is direct, inthat it gives the surface-pressure distribution and shock shape fora prescribed body .  results obtained by numerical integrationfor several body shapes at several mach numbers are comparedto experimental results with good agreement .  it is also shownthat the method can be successfully applied to pointed bodieswith attached shock .  in the stagnation region, simplerelationships are found from the equations of the first approximationwhich connect the surface-velocity gradient, shock curvature,shock-detachment distance, and body curvature .  theserelations are also correlated with experiment for a variety of shapesas a function of mach number .  the correlations permit a rapidestimate of the stagnation-point velocity gradient, important forheat-transfer calculations, for any blunt body from the shockstand-off distance .  a method for a higher approximation isdescribed, for which, in contrast to the higher approximations ofbelotserkovskii, a large number of simultaneous total differentialequations with unknown parameters does not occur .  one formof this method has been studied numerically .  results are givenwhich, though only partially successful, indicate the amount ofimprovement to be expected from a higher approximation .
