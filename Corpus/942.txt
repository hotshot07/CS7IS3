secondary gas injection in a conical rocket nozzle .  data are presented on side forces generatedby secondary gas injection in a 15 conicalrocket exhaust nozzle .  the side force was measureddirectly with a force transducer and thedata examined in terms of an amplificationfactor, where is the measured effectivespecific impulse of injectant, and is thespecific impulse of injectant for sonic flow into avacuum .  injection was normal to the axisof the nozzle through a single circular orifice at afixed point in the diverging portion of the nozzle .a variety of ambient temperature gaseousinjectants and orifice diameters were carefully studied .injectant flow rate was varied for each configuration .the main propellant was hot gas (catalytically decomposed), and motor conditionswere held essentially constant .
