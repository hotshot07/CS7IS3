calculation of sideslip derivatives and pressure distributionin asymmetric flight conditions on a slender wing-finconfiguration .  the flow around slender wing-finconfigurations having curved leadingedges, whose shape is defined by polynomials,is considered .  a generalexpression for the pressure distributionon such a configuration inasymmetric flow is derived and thederivatives due to the particular caseof sideslipping motion are also given .no numerical results are given forwing-fin load distribution, but thesideslip derivatives have beenevaluated in a number of cases forgothic and ogee wings .
