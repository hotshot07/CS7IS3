experimental studies of flutter of buckled rectangularpanels at mach numbers from 1. 2 to 3. 0 includingeffects of pressure differential and of panelwidth-length ratio .  experimental panel flutter data have been obtained at mach numbersfrom 1.2 to 3.0 for buckled rectangular panels and the effect of apressure differential has been determined .  increasing the pressuredifferential was effective in eliminating flutter on most of the panelstested .  the effects of the variables in the panel flutter parametersure, e is young's modulus, and t and l are the panel thickness andlength, respectively) were investigated for buckled panels clamped onthe front and rear edges and a critical value of this parameter of 0.44is indicated at zero pressure differential when the panel width-lengthratio is 0.69 .  an estimated flutter boundary is presented for buckledpanels clamped on four edges, with width-length ratios of 0.21 to 4.0 .this boundary shows that the panel width is more significant than thepanel length when the ratio of width to length is less thanapproximately 0.5 .  panels clamped on four edges and buckled in two half wavesin the direction of flow were found to be particularly susceptible toflutter .  the results of limited tests on panels with applied damping,curvature, and lengthwise stiffeners are also presented and discussed .
