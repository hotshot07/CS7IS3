experimental study of the random vibrations of an aircraftstructure excited by jet noise .  recordings have been made of the strains induced in afull scale rear fuselage test structure of the caravelleair-liner when one jet engine is running at maximumtake-off thrust .  the analysis has been concentrated on thestrains in the centres of panels .  correlationmeasurements indicate that the larger panel strains occur aboveresonance peak in each panel has been identified with thefundamental stringer-twisting mode but the mode-shapes forthe two smaller peaks have not been completely determined .an attempt has been made to calculate the panel resonantfrequencies theoretically .
