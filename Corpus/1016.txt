principles of creep buckling weight-strength analysis .





principles of creep buckling weight-strength analysis .  the relation of the time-dependent tangent-modulusload--as conceived by shanley--to actual column capacityis clarified .  it may be interpreted as a limiting case of theconservative estimate .  the time-dependenttangent-modulus load is, therefore, an approximation to aconservative estimate .  the approximation, however, maybe either conservative or nonconservative when appliedto imperfect or real columns .  typical cases are discussedand experimental results for two alloys are cited .
