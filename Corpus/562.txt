concerning the effect of compressibility on laminarboundary layers and their separation .  the theory of compressible flow in a laminarboundary layer has been developed for thecase when the viscosity is assumed to beproportional to the absolute temperature and theprandtl number is unity .  (these assumptionsmay be compared with the empirical relationssuggested by cope .)it is shown that a transformation of the ordinatenormal to the layer can lead to a simplifiedform of equation of motion very similar to theordinary incompressible equation but modifiedby a multiplicative factor g in the pressureterm .  this factor is greater than unity at theboundary and tends to one at the outside ofthe layer .  several particular solutions are consideredincluding accelerated flow with a linearlyincreasing velocity and retarded flow along aflat plate with a linearly decreasing velocity .  the general implications of the theory arediscussed and qualitative conclusions are drawnwhen the mainstream velocity starts froma stagnation point, rises to a maximum andsubsequently falls .  it is concluded that forsuch a velocity distribution increasingcompressibility will reduce the skin friction, increasethe boundary layer thickness and causeearlier separation as compared with the incompressibleflow with the same mainstream velocitydistribution and the kinematic viscosity correspondingto conditions at the stagnation point .
