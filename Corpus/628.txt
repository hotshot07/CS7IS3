thermal effects on a transpiration cooled hemisphere .  an approximate method is used to obtain theinjection distribution which would exist on an isothermal,transpiration-cooled hemisphere in a supersonic stream .this distribution is the same for both air and heliuminjection, and is independent of the blowing level .  amodel having this distribution was tested in the navalsupersonic laboratory wind tunnel at a mach numberof 3.53 .  it is concluded that the design technique isreasonably accurate .  data taken near the nose arecompared with the theories for air and heliuminjection .  the agreement in the case of the reduction inheat-transfer coefficient is good .  the values ofinsulated wall temperature obtained near the nose withhelium injection are 8 percent above the localstagnation temperature, and largely independent of injectionrate .  it is believed that this phenomenon may beattributed to the thermal diffusion of the helium withinthe boundary layer .  air injection causes a slightreduction in the insulated wall temperature .  it is shownthat injection of either air or helium at the hemispherenose considerably reduces the heat flux at the surface .the additional reduction in heat flux resulting fromhelium injection as opposed to air injection, andpredicted by existing theory, is largely absent .
