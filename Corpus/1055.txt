non-linear bending and buckling of circular plates .  iterative solutions of finite differenceapproximations of the non-linear von karmanplate equations are presented .  resultsare obtained for circular plates under avariety of boundary conditions subjected toeither uniform lateral pressure or uniformedge thrust .  the solution, carried out numerically onthe aec univac at new york university,yields a complete description of stressesand deflections for an apparently unlimitedrange of load parameters .  in addition, boundarylayer phenomena are discussed .  forcomputing purposes, this iterative method provesto be superior to the previously usedpower series method and may be applicable toother non-linear problems .
