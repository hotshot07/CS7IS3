free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic .





free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic .  representative experimental results are presented to show thecurrent status of the panel flutter problem .  results are presented forunstiffened rectangular panels and for rectangular panels stiffened bycorrugated backing .  flutter boundaries are established for all typesof panels when considered on the basis of equivalent isotropic plates .the effects of mach number, differential pressure, and aerodynamicheating on panel flutter are discussed .  a flutter analysis oforthotropic panels is presented in the appendix .
