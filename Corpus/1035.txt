note on creep buckling of columns .  the stability of a compressed elasticring has been studied by a method whichcan be extended to solve the problemof the stability of a flexible heavy structurespread by a system of hoops as in a crinolineskirt .  the original work by levy, whichwas developed by timoshenko and love,cannot be generalized to problems inwhich the compressing forces are affected bythe deformation of the ring .  it is shown that the load at which a ringwill buckle depends not only upon themagnitude of the load but also upon its firstderivative relative to the radial distance .a positive derivative causes the ring tobuckle at a higher load .  when this resultis applied to a cone of heavy and looselydraped fabric spread by a rigid hoop ofradius and a larger and flexible hoopof radius below it, both hoops being inhorizontal planes, then various modesof buckling other than oval are possibleaccording to the relative magnitudes ofand .  it is found that oval bucklingchanges to three-wave buckling whenthree-wave changes tofour-wave when, and as andapproach nearer to equality the buckledform progressively changes to more waves .when applied to a structure spread bymany horizontal hoops of which the topone is rigid and oval, it is found that allother hoops, if each is designed to thecriterion, will have the sameabsolute deviation from circularity as therigid hoop .  if any one hoop is designedso that, then the oval shape ofthe rigid hoop is magnified on all flexiblehoops .
