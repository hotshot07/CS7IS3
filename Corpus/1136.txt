design of thin walled torispherical and toriconicalpressure - vessel heads .  the failure under hydrostatic test of a large storage vesseldesigned in accordance with current practice stimulated earlieranalytical studies .  this paper gives curves and a table useful forthe design and analysis of the knuckle region of a thintorispherical or toriconical head of an unfired cylindrical vessel .  a simplebut surprisingly adequate approximate formula is presented forthe limit pressure, np, at which appreciable plastic deformationsoccur ..where p is the design pressure, is the yield stress of thematerial, and n is the factor of safety .  the thickness t of the knuckleregion is assumed uniform .  upper and lower bound calculationswere made for ratios of knuckle radius r to cylinder diameter dof 0.06, 0.08, 0.10, 0.12, 0.14, and 0.16, and ratios of spherical capradius l to d of 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, and 0.6 .  toriconic1a heads maybe designed or analyzed closely enough by interpreting intable 1 as the complement of the half angle of the cone .
