general airfoil theory .on the assumption of infinitely small disturbances the author developsa generalized integral equation of airfoil theory which is applicableto any motion and compressible fluid . successive specializations yieldvarious simpler integral equations, such as possio's, birnbaum's, andprandtl's integral equations, as well as new ones for the wing ofinfinite span with periodic downwash distribution and for the oscillatingwing with high aspect ratio . lastly, several solutions and methods forsolving these integral equations are given .
