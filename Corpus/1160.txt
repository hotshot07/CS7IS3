recent advances in gaseous detonation .  a review of recent work in gaseous detonationis presented .  early work is briefly mentioned andtreatises listed .  theoretical calculations ofchapman-jouguet detonations are reviewed,compared and the ambiguity concerning the speed ofsound in a reacting gas mixture discussed .experimental chapman-jouguet measurements arereviewed .  recent studies of the interior of adetonation wave are presented .  standing detonationwave research, detonation limits, two-dimensionaldetonations, spectra, ionization and magnetohydrodynamictreatments are brought to the reader'sattention .  a qualitative description of thedevelopment of a flame to a detonation is presented .experimental observations are examined andrecent theoretical attempts to explain theseobservations are reviewed .
