flexural vibrations of the walls of thin cylindricalshells having freely supported ends .the paper deals with the general equations for the vibration of thincylinders and a theoretical and experimental investigation is made ofthe type of vibration usually associated with bells .  the cylinders aresupported in such a manner that the ends remain circular withoutdirectional restraint being imposed .  it is found that the complexityof the mode of vibration bears little relation to the naturalfrequency,. for example, cylinders of very small thickness-diameterratio, with length about equal to or less than the diameter, may havemany of their higher frequencies associated with the simpler modes ofvibration .  the frequency equation which is derived by the energymethod is based on strain relations given by timoshenko .  in thisapproach, displacement equations are evolved which are comparable tothose of love and flugge, though differences are evident due to thestrain expressions used by each author .  results are given forcylinders of various lengths, each with the same thickness-diameterratio, and also for a very thin cylinder in which the simpler modes ofvibration occur in the higher frequency range .  it is shown that thereare three possible natural frequencies for a particular nodal pattern,two of these normally occurring beyond the aural range .
