ionization nonequilibrium in expanding flows .  approximate methods are developed for solvingthe electron-ion kinetic equations in expandingquasi one-dimensional airflows .  results are obtainedfor inviscid nozzle flows at conditionsappropriate to shock tunnel testing and are comparedwith exact numerical solutions .  effects on rftransmission and d-c conductivity are examined .since two-body deionization never fully freezesin the flows considered here, the assumption of suddenfreezing gives an upper bound on the residualionization at large area ratios .  the use of anasymptotic form of solution with the freezingcriterion provides an improved estimate for such cases .ionization nonequilibrium is alsoconsidered for the plasma sheath associated with blunthypersonic bodies flying at high altitudes .the influence of atomic ions is examined for typicalre-entry conditions .
