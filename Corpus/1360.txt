simplified analysis of general instability of stiffenedshells in pure bending .  although much work has been done to develop a theory forthe failure of shells by general instability, there is at present nosimple method by which the size of the frames may be determinedfor any given diameter, bending moment,.and frame spacing .such a method is needed in determining the optimum design forstiffened shells, to be used as a basis for weight analysis offuselages, and other shell structures .  in an extension of the workdone for the rand corporation, a simple coefficient has beendetermined for this purpose .  since it appears that this methodmay also be useful in design calculations, a brief description ispresented below .
