a study of the acoustic fatigue characteristics ofsome flat and curved aluminium panels exposed to randomand discrete noise .  a study was made of the fatiguelife of simple 2024-t3aluminum-alloy panels measuring 11 by 13inches and exposed to bothdiscrete-frequency noise from a siren andrandom noise from an air jet .  noiselevels varied from approximatelypanel variables included thickness,edge conditions, curvature, andstatic-pressure differential .  no significant differences were notedin the nature of failuresexperienced for the two types of loadings .at a given root-mean-squarestress level, the failure times weregenerally shorter for the randomloading than for the discrete-frequencyloading .  these differences infailure times were noted to be a functionof stress level, the largerdifferences occurring at the lower stress levels .  increases in time to failure wereobtained as a result of increasedpanel thickness, increased panel curvature,and particularly for increasedstatic-pressure differential across curved panels .  for the discrete-type loading,the location of weak points in thesesimplified structural designs can besatisfactorily accomplished butquantitative predictions of fatiguelife are much more difficult .
