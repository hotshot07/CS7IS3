aerofoil theory of a flat delta wing at supersonicspeeds .  lift, drag, and pressure distribution of a triangularflat plate moving at a small incidence at supersonicspeeds are given for arbitrary mach number and aspect ratio .the values obtained for lift and drag are compared withthe corresponding values obtained by strip theory .  thepossibility of further applications of the analysis leading upto the above results is indicated .
