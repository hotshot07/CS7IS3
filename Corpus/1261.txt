a method of calculating velocity distribution for turbulentboundary layers in adverse pressure distributions .  a new method of calculating the behavior of turbulentboundary layers in adverse pressure distributions is developed whichpermits direct determination of the velocity profile rather thanthe gross integral parameters normally used to infer the generalcharacter of the boundary layer .  the method offers thesimplicity of algebraic equations coupled with the use of chartsrather than the laborious simultaneous solution of coupleddifferential equations required by existing methods .  the method alsoaffords, for the first time, a means of determining the totalboundary-layer thickness, thus allowing calculation of the absolute aswell as the nondimensional velocity distribution .the velocity profile is considered to be composed of tworegions--an inner region which is described by the law of the walland an outer region which is described by a function depictingthe deviation from that law .  the deviation function involvestwo parameters which are uniquely dependent upon theskin-friction coefficient and a third parameter which, for practicalpurposes, can be considered a constant .  since the entirevelocity distribution was found to be almost uniquely dependentupon the local skin friction, serious doubt is cast upon thegenerally accepted /history concept/ which considers the outer regionof the boundary layer to be dependent on integrated upstreamconditions .  agreement between experimental velocity distributions andthose calculated by the method presented here is generally verygood .  the analysis and calculation procedures which arepresented are applicable to two-dimensional, pseudo-two-dimensional, and axisymmetric conical flows .
