the elliptic cylinder in a shear flow with hyperbolicvelocity profile .  the stream function for the shear flow with hyperbolicvelocity profile past an elliptic cylinder has been determinedas an infinite series of mathieu functions .  it is found thatthe stagnation streamline of the flow is displaced towardsa region of higher velocity, this displacement increasingthe main stream, (2) as the stream becomes progressivelynon-uniform, (3) with increase of minor axis length whenthe major axis length remains invariant .  in each case thedisplacement reaches a limiting value as the cylinder moves awayfrom the axis of symmetry of the stream .  these limitingvalues are reached at critical distances from the axis of symmetry,which decrease as the stream becomes progressively non-uniform,but these distances are approximately independent of incidence .  the pressure coefficients and the resultant force and momentcoefficients associated with the cylinder have also been obtained,and investigated numerically for the flat plate type of cylinder .
