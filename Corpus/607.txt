duct flow in magnetohydrodynamics .  this paper is an extension of the work of hartmann (2) and sherclifftransverse magnetic fields -- the simplest class of magnetohydrodynamicproblems .  we are concerned here mainly with the boundary valueproblems associated with flow in ducts with conducting walls .
