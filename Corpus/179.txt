an analysis of base pressure at supersonic speeds andcomparison with experiment .  in the first part of theinvestigation an analysis is made of basepressure in an inviscid fluid,both for two-dimensional andaxially-symmetric flow .  it is shown thatfor two-dimensional flow, and also forthe flow over a body of revolutionwith a cylindrical sting attached tothe base, there are an infinitenumber of possible solutions satisfyingall necessary boundary conditionsat any given free-stream mach number .for the particular case of a bodyhaving no sting attached only onesolution is possible in an inviscidflow, but it corresponds to zerobase drag .  accordingly, it is concludedthat a strictly inviscid-fluidtheory cannot be satisfactory for practical applications .  since the exact inviscid-fluidtheory does not adequately describethe conditions of a real fluid flow,an approximate semi-empirical theoryfor base pressure in a viscous fluidis developed in a second part of theinvestigation .  the semi-empiricaltheory is based partly oninviscid-flow calculations, and is restrictedto airfoils and bodies withoutboat-tailing .  in this theory an attemptis made to allow for the effects ofmach number, reynolds number, profileshape, and type of boundary-layerflow .  the results of some recentexperimental measurements of basepressure in two-dimensional andaxially-symmetric flow are presented forpurposes of comparison .  someexperimental results also are presentedconcerning the support interferenceeffect of a cylindrical sting, andthe interference effect of a reflectedbow wave on measurements of basepressure in a supersonic wind tunnel .
