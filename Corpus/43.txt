the relation between wall temperature and the effectof roughness on boundary layer transition .the experimentally demonstrated rise and subsequentfall of transition reynolds number with decreasing wall-to-ambient temperature ratio has been the subject of two recentnotes .  in both cases it was argued that the increasedeffectiveness of roughness due to wall cooling was not sufficient toexplain the transition-reversal phenomenon on nominally smoothbodies .  in one case, the criterion for transition reversal wastaken to be and in the other values of as low aseter is a reynolds number formed from velocity andkinematic viscosity based on calculated conditions at the height ofroughness element k in the undisturbed, laminar boundary layerat the station of roughness location .  the present note issubmitted to show that another method for evaluating the effectof roughness on transition leads to an opposite conclusion .
