application to turbulent separations is made for a prandtl number of

unity in low-speed flow without injection .
all calculations are for the case of zero boundary-layer thickness at
the position of separation .
     for alminar separations the differential equations for viscous flow
at arbitrary mach number are solved for the enthalpy and velocity
profiles within the thin layer where mixing with dead air takes place .
results are presented in tabular form for prandtl numbers between 0.1
and 10  . the rate of heat transfer to a separated laminar region in air
laminar boundary layer having the same constant pressure . injection
of gas into the separated region is calculated to have a powerful effect
in reducing the rate of heat transfn  to the wall  . it is calculated
that a moderate quantity of gas injection reduces to zero the heat
transfer in a laminar separated flow .
