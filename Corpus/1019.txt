note on creep buckling of columns .





note on creep buckling of columns .  a method for estimating allowableload capacities of columns subjectto creep is presented .  the method,which utilizes approximate stressdistributions derived fromisochronous-stress-strain curves to estimatecolumn load capacities, is shown tobe conservative for the time for whichthe estimate is made .  an application of the method ismade to test data on as-received andon stabilized 24s-t4 aluminum alloy .a comparison of the computed columncapacities with experimental capacitiesindicates that the method issatisfactory for estimating the decrease incapacity with increasing time .  easily obtained, time-dependenttangent-modulus loads are discussed .they are interpreted as being approximationsto allowable load-capacityestimates .  a limited application is made totest data, and the resultsappear promising .  it is concluded that ifcertain limitations are recognized,the method may prove to be useful becauseof its simplicity .  a presentation of the results of anexperimental investigation of theeffects of column imperfection andcolumn-material variation is made .  itis found that column-capacity variations ofthe order of 10 per cent canresult from column-imperfection differencesand column-material variation .  the results of an experimental study ofthe variation of columncapacity with temperature of exposure are presented .they indicate that columnefficiency, as measured by decrease in capacity,can be acceptable for veryshort times at the higher temperatures .  theefficiency at these highertemperatures falls rapidly, however, with increasing time .
