flow of chemically reacting gas mixtures .  suitable forms of the equationsfor the flow of an inviscid,non-heat-conducting gas in which chemicalreactions are occurring are derived .the effects of mass diffusion andnon-equilibrium amongst the internalmodes of the molecules are neglected .  special attention is given tothe speeds of sound in such a gasmixture and a general expression forthe ratio of frozen to equilibriumsound speeds is deduced .  an exampleis given for the ideal dissociatinggas .  the significance of the velocitydefined by the ratio of the convectivederivatives of pressure and density isexplained .  it is the velocitywhich exists at the throat of aconvergent-divergent duct under maximummass flow conditions, and it is shown thatthis velocity depends on thenozzle geometry as well as on the 'reservoir' conditions .  as an illustration the phenomena ofsound absorption and dispersion arediscussed for the ideal dissociating gas .the results can be conciselyexpressed in terms of the frozen andequilibrium sound speeds, thefrequency of the (harmonic) soundvibration and a characteristic time forthe rate of progress of the reaction .
