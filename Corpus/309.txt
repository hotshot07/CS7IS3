on the motion of a flat plate at high speed in a viscouscompressible fluid, ii, steady motion .  the theory of the steady flow of a viscous compressible fluidpast a flat plate at high mach number due to lees andprobstein is extended by a more complete discussion of the flow inthe inviscid layer between the shock wave and the boundary layer .it is shown that similar solutions exist in this layer, analogouslyto those found by li and nagamatsu in the boundary layer, andthat the two may be joined to give, allowing one minorassumption, a full account of the flow .  it is shown that theboundary-layer equations may be reduced to those for an incompressiblefluid and that the von karman-pohlhausen method describesthe flow in it with good accuracy .  the tangent wedgeapproximation for the pressure on the plate, used by lees and hiscollaborators, is found to be in deficitby 10 per cent for air .  finally,it is shown that the theory for weak interaction cannot beextended further without a complete knowledge of the flow .
