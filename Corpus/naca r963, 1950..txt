investigation with an interferometer of the turbulent
mixing of a free supersonic jet .
  the free turbulent mixing of a supersonic jet of mach number
of which a description is given, was used for the investigation .
density and velocity distributions through the mixing zone
have been obtained .  it was found that there was similarity
in distribution at the cross sections investigated and that, in
the subsonic portion of the mixing zone, the velocity
distribution fitted the theoretical distribution for incompressible flow .
it was found that the rates of spread of the mixing zone both
into the jet and into the ambient air were less than those of
subsonic jets .
