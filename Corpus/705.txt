on the kernel function of the integral equation relating the lift anddownwash distributions of oscillating finite wings in subsonic flow .this report treats the kernel function of an integral equation thatrelates a known or prescribed downwash distribution to an unknown liftdistribution for a harmonically oscillating finite wing in compressiblesubsonic flow . the kernel function is reduced to a form that can beaccurately evaluated by separating the kernel function into two parts .. a part in which the singularities are isolated and analyticallyexpressed and a nonsingular part which may be tabulated . the form of thekernel function for the sonic case /mach number of 1/ is treatedseparately . in addition, results for the special cases of mach numberof o /incompressible case/ and frequency of o /steady case/ are given .the derivation of the integral equation which involves this kernelfunction, originally performed elsewhere /see, for example, nacatechnical memorandum 979/, is reproduced as an appendix . another appendixgives the reduction of the form of the kernel function obtained hereinfor the three-dimensional case to a known result of possio fortwo-dimensional flow . a third appendix contains some remarks on theevaluation of the kernel function, and a fourth appendix presents analternate form of expression for the kernel function .
