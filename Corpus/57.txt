applicability of the hypersonic similarity rule topressure distributions which include the effects ofrotation for bodies of revolution at zero angle ofattack .  the analysis of technical note 2250, 1950, is extended to includethe effects of flow rotation .  it isfound that the theoretical pressuredistributions over ogive cylinders can be related by the hypersonicsimilarity rule with sufficient accuracy for most engineering purposes .  the error introduced into pressure distributions and drag of ogivecylinders by ignoring the rotation term in the characteristic equationsis investigated .  it is found thatthe influence of the rotation term onpressure distribution and drag depends only upon the similarityparameter k (mach number divided by fineness ratio) .although the error indrag, due to neglect of the rotation term, is negligible at k=0.5, theerror is about 30 percent at k=2.0 .  charts are presented for the rapid determination of pressuredistributions for rotational flow overogive cylinders for all values ofthe similarity parameter between 0.5 andof mach number and fineness ratio .
