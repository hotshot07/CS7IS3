a simple method of matric structural analysis, partiv, non-linear problems .  the method presented in the previous parts is employed tosolve various kinds of nonlinear problems, such as problemsconcerning large deflections or buckling, or thermal creep, orinelastic stress redistribution involving thermal gradients, ordesign .  the procedure used in each case is one of directiteration--i. e., after one assumes a starting point all subsequent cycles areself-generating .  simple numerical examples are worked out .
