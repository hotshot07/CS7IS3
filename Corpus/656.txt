departure from dissociation equilibrium in a hypersonic nozzle .the equations of motion for the flow of an ideal dissociating gasthrough a nearly conical nozzle have been solved numerically, assuminga simple equation for the rate of dissociation, and a number ofdifferent values of the rate constant . the results of thesecalculations suggest that deviations from dissociation equilibrium willoccur in the nozzle if the rate constant lies within a very wide rangeof values . they also suggest that once such a deviation has begun thegas will very rapidly/freeze/, so that the dissociation fraction willremain almost constant if the flow is expanded further, or even if itpasses through a constant area test section . an approximate methodof solution, making use of this property of sudden/freezing/of the flow, has been developed and applied to the problem of estimating thedeviations from equilibrium under a wide range of conditions . if allthe assumptions made in this report are accepted, then lack ofdissociation equilibrium may be expected in the working sections ofhypersonic wind tunnels and hypersonic shock tubes .it is shown, however, that the flow behind a normal shock wave in such a wind tunnel will not be greatly affected by any freezing that may takeplace in the nozzle upstream of the shock wave . even so, the stand-offdistance of a shock wave in front of a blunt model may be quitesensitive to deviations from equilibrium .
