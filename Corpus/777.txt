a technique for rendering approximate solutions tophysical problems uniformly valid .  a method is described for treatingsome of the characteristicallynon-linear problems of physics, inparticular those involving a non-linearpartial differential equation forwhich an approximate linearization ispermissible everywhere except in alimited region, such as theneighbourhood of (5) a singular characteristicof the approximate solution, or ofapproximation is valueless .  themethod involves a transformation ofan independent variable, which isdetermined progressively with successiveapproximations to the solution ..only one step being necessary if afirst approximation valid uniformlybe obtained .  the method is mosteasily understood in its applicationto simple first order ordinarydifferential equations, which arestudied in detail in 2 and 3 as apreparation for the extension tomore complicated problems in 4, 5and 6 .  physically, the longestsection, 6, concerns the /spread/ ofa progressive wave at infinity,an important and essentially non-linearprocess .
