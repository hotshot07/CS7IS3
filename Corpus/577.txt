on hypersonic similitude .  tsien in a recent paper (j. math. phys. mass. inst. tech.sonic flows around slender bodies and has pointed out thatthe product of mach number and fineness ratio is a basicsimilarity parameter .  the author enlarges on this notion,indicating that the problem of hypersonic flow about aslender body in three dimensions is the same as that of acertain two-dimensional nonsteady flow (with time replacingthe lengthwise spatial coordinate) characterized byessentially the same similarity parameter .
