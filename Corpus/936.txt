a donnell-type theory for asymmetrical bending andbuckling of thin conical shells .  equations, somewhat more accurate than those recentlypresented by n. j. hoff, are derived for bending andbuckling of thin circular conical shells under arbitrary loading .these equations reduce to donnell's equations for thincylindrical shells when the cone semivertex angle becomesvery small and the minimum radius of curvature of themedian surface approaches a constant value .  at theother end of the scale the equations reduce to thewell-known equations for flat circular plates when the conesemivertex angle approaches a right angle .  in addition,for the entire range of cone semivertex angles theequations reduce to the known equations for axisymmetricalbending when variations of the displacements around thecircumference vanish .  the problem of bending isreduced to the solution of a single fourth-order partialdifferential equation with variable coefficients .
