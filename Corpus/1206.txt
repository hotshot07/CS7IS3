magnetohydrodynamic mach cones .  features of the surfaces of main disturbance created by a smallobject in steady motion through a conducting fluid are examined .these surfaces are found by drawing tangent cones from theobject to the relevant wave-front diagrams .  the outer wavecone (when present) is smooth, but the two inner cones havecross sections similar to the cusped figures of the innerwave-front diagram .  it is conjectured that the disturbance may beconcentrated along such line cusps .  this has particularrelevance in the application of known two-dimensional results tothree-dimensional problems, say in the well-known techniquesof aerodynamics .  in mhd the omission of the large disturbancecharacteristics implicit in a two-dimensional solution mayinvalidate its use in any practical three-dimensional problem .
