an investigation of the influence of lift on sonic-boomintensity by means of wind tunnel measurements of thepressure fields of several wing-body combinations ata mach number of 2. 01 .  an investigation of the effectof lift on sonic-boom intensity hasbeen performed by means of wind-tunnelmeasurements of the pressure fieldssurrounding small wing-body combinations .the tests were conducted inthe langley 4- by 4-foot supersonicpressure tunnel at a mach number ofper foot .  effects of lift werefound to be real and significant .measured bow-shock intensities agreedfairly well with, but were consistentlyless than, shock intensitiesestimated by theoretical methods .available flight data were examinedfor correlation with wind-tunnel testresults .
