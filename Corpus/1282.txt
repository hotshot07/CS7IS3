compressible flat-plate boundary-layer flow with anapplied magnetic field .  the laminar boundary-layer equations are formulated andsolved for a flat plate in high-speed compressible air flow whereequilibrium dissociation and ionization are assumed and wherethere is an applied magnetic field having its component normalto the plate proportional to .  the skin-friction andheat-transfer characteristics are determined for free-stream velocitiesof up to 17,500 meters sec. and magnetic fields of up to about  the results show that the skin friction and heat transfer at agiven free-stream velocity decrease with increasing magneticfield strength, and the percentage reduction is constant alongthe length of the plate .  they also exhibit the same hysteresisbehavior as was first found in the case of magnetoaerodynamiccouette flow,. however, for the flat plate the hysteresis effectdisappears at a higher mach number .  furthermore, it wasfound that the reduction in heat transfer with increasing fieldstrength is opposite in behavior from that for couette flow .
