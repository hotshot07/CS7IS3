experimental study of the vibrations of a circularcylindrical shell .  an apparatus is described which permits the modeshape of a vibrating circular cylindrical shell to beobtained quite easily .  these measurements are madewithout contacting the cylinder and can be convertedto actual lineal values .  a representative number ofresults obtained with such a system are shown toillustrate the relationship between the nodal pattern andfrequency in a cylinder as well as the effect of internalpressure on these frequencies .  finally, comparisonsare made between these results and timoshenko theoryand an appropriate shell theory .
