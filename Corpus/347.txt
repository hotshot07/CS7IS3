boundary layer measurements in hypersonic flow .  experimental data are presented on boundary-layer formation,heat transfer, and skin-friction coefficient at mach numbers ofthe wall of a conical nozzle in the presence of a favorable pressuregradient and several rates of heat transfer .  the reynoldsnumber based on momentum thickness varied from 1,500 to 3,500 .comparison is made with data at lower mach numbers and withthe semiempirical theory of von karman .  the existing data upto mach numbers of nine indicate agreement to within 5 percent when compared with a form of the wilson theory, but it isclear that the effects of heat transfer and pressure gradientspresent problems which require extensive study and experiment inthe future .
