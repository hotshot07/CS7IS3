control system and analysis and design via the second method oflyapunov .the/second method/of lyapunov is the most general approach currently inthe theory of stability of dynamic systems . after a rigorous exposition of the fundamental concepts of this theory, applications are made to/a/stability of linear stationary, linear nonslationary, and nonlinearsystems,./b/estimation of transient behavior,./c/control-systemoptimization,./d/design of relay servos . the discussion is essentiallyself-contained, with emphasis on the thorough development of theprincipal ideas and mathematical tools . only systems governed bydifferential equations are treated here . systems governed by differenceequations are the subject of a companion paper .
