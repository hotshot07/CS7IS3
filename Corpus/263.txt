cylindrical shock waves produced by instantaneous energyrelease .  taylor's analysis of the intense spherical explosionhas been extended to the cylindrical case .  it is foundthat the radius r of a strong cylindrical shock waveproduced by a sudden release of energy e per unit lengthgrows with time t according to the equationwhere is the atmospheric density andis a calculated function of the specificheat ratio .  for is found to be approximatelyunity .  for this case, the pressure behind theshock wave decays with radius r according to the relation .applying the results of this analysisto the case of hypersonic flight, it can be shown thatthe shock envelope behind a meteor or a high-speedmissile is approximately a paraboloid given bywhere d and v denote the totaldrag and the velocity of the missile, respectively,and x is the distance behind the missile .
