one-dimensional transient heat conduction into a double-layerslab subjected to a linear heat input for a small timeinternal .  analytic solutions are presented for the transient heatconduction in composite slabs exposed at one surface to atriangular heat rate .  this type of heating rate may occur, forexample, during aerodynamic heating .
