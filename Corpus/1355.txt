boundary layer displacement effects in air at machnumbers of 6. 8 and 9. 6.  measurements are presented for pressuregradients induced by a laminar boundary layer on aflat plate in air at a mach number of 9.6 and for thedrag of thin wings at a mach number of about 6.8and zero angle of attack .  the pressuremeasurements at a mach number of 9.6 were made in thepresence of substantial heat transfer from theboundary layer to the plate surface .  the measuredpressure distribution on the surface of the plate waspredicted with good accuracy by a modification toinsulated-plate displacement theory which allowsfor the effect of the heat transfer and temperaturegradient along the surface on the boundary-layerdisplacement thickness .  the total drag of thin wings with square and deltaplan forms was measured at a nominal mach numberof 6.8 over a reasonably wide range of reynoldsnumbers .  the total drag was found to be greaterthan can be explained by adding a classical value oflaminar skin friction to the estimated pressure drag .the difference is, in general, explained by theincrease in skin friction (20 to 40 percent) caused bythe boundary-layer-induced pressures .
