blunt-cone pressure distributions at hypersonic mach numbers .the static pressure distributions on the surface of ablunted 7.5 degree-half-angle cone have recently been experimentallydetermined in the cal 48 inch hypersonic shock tunnel .  thisfacility and the associated instrumentation are described in detailin ref. 1 .  these tests covered a mach number range of 8 to 18at a reynolds number per foot of approximately 1 times 10 to the 5thpower., the models included one flat-faced cone and two hemisphericallyblunted cones .
