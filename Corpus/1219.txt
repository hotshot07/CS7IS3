determination of lift or drag programs to minimizere-entry heating .  a study of single-pass re-entry from escape speed and fromcircular satellite speed is made to determine the lift program for ahypersonic glider and the drag-modulation program for anon-lifting vehicle that minimize the heating of the vehicles withinacceleration or range constraints .  a new method of numericalsolution is used, similar to kelley's /method of gradients,/ thatpermits rapid convergence to the optimum lift program startingwith an original good estimate .  this method avoids thetwo-point boundary-value problem of the calculus-of-variationsformulation, and is applicable to any optimum-programingproblem .  an acceleration-tolerance limit is introduced whichdescribes the human pilot's capability to withstand accelerationmore accurately than a simple acceleration limit .
