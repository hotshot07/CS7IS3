a technique for improving the predictions of linearisedtheory on the drag of straight edge wings .  the curve of drag against mach number for straight-edged wings,calculated by using the linearised theory of supersonic flow, displaysdiscontinuities in slope at the various mach numbers for which the edgesare sonic .  these features, which are not observed in practice, are dueto the fact that linearised theory predicts an infinite pressure alonga subsonic or sonic edge .  it is shown that if the linearised equationof supersonic flow is used to determine the flow over straight-edgedwings, but the linearised boundary condition is replaced by the fullplaced by plausible values .  on this basis a simple method is derivedfor improving the linearised predictions of the drag of straight-edgedwings which exhibits satisfactory agreement with experimental results .  while the technique is not directly applicable to ridge lines, anartifice renders them amenable to similar treatment .
