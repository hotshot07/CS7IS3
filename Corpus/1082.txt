the flow past pitot tube at low reynolds numbers, part 1-dash thenumerical solution of the navier-stokes equations for steady viscousaxisymmetric flow, part 2-dash the effects of viscosity and orificesize on a pitot tube at low reynolds numbers .in this report numerical methods used to solve the navier-stokesequations for steady viscous two-dimensional flow are extended to includethe case of axial symmetry . the equations and their finite differenceapproximations are derived working in cylindrical polar co-ordinateswith the stokes' stream function and the vorticity as variables . a newmethod of dealing with the boundary conditions is given .the effects of viscosity and orlfice size on a blunt-nosed pitot tubehave been theoretically investigated up to a reynolds number of ten,where the reynolds number has been based on the radius of the tube .results are expressed in terms of a pressure coefficient where p is thepressure measured in the tube, p the density of the fluid, and p  and uthe static pressure and velocity in an undisturbed flow at the positionof the tube .the values of c for a blunt-nosed tube are found to be less than thosefor tubes with hemispheroidal heads, but always greater than unity inthe range considered . the effect of the orifice size is to decrease cas the orifice size increases, this decrease is very small but increases with the reynolds number . at a reynolds number of ten the decrease isat most five per cent of the value of c when there is no orifice .it is suggested that the decrease of c below unity found in someexperimental investigations at a higher reynolds number could be due to theeffects of orifice size .
