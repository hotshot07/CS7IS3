an extension of donnell's equation for a circular cylindrical shell .in 1933, donnell succeeded in simplifying the equations of equilibriumfor a circular cylindrical shellhe obtained simple relations between the critical buckling shearingstress and the physical properties of a thin circular cylinder underpure torsion .  his approach reduces the tedious computations involvedin the classical solutions and is still in good agreement with them .furthermore, it is easy to show that the well-known classical solutionfor critical compressive stress of the cylinder under axial compressioncan readily be obtained from donnell's equation .
