an investigation at subsonic speeds of aerodynamic characteristics atangles of attack from -dash 4degrees to 100degrees of a delta-wingreentry configuration having folding wingtip panels .an investigation was made at subsonic speeds in the langley highspeedlifting reentry configuration having folding wingtip panels . theconfiguration is of the type used in a high angle-of-attack /near 90degree/ reentry to minimize aerodynamic heating . by unfolding the wingtippanels into the airstream, a moderate angle-of-attack glide is used fora controlled landing . the basic configuration tested utilized awhose area was 25 percent of the total wing area . the effects ofvarying the plan form and size of the wingtip panels was studied as well as the effects of unfolding the wingtip panels in a high angle-of-attack attitude . tests were made at mach numbers of 0.40, 0.60, and
