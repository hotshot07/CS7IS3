a collection of longitudinal stability derivativesof wings at supersonic speeds .  a collection has been made oftheoretical data, for wings alone, onthose stability derivatives that governthe short-period oscillation ofaircraft travelling at supersonic speeds .all the derivatives availablehave been obtained by means of the lineartheory, and so the informationgiven is subject to the usual limitations .the information has beenpresented in what is hoped is the mostconvenient form to show its extent,and to expose the parts of the fieldwhere experimental investigation ismost needed .
