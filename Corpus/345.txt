the interaction of shock waves with boundary layeron a flat surface .  the development of supersonic compressors, supersonicdiffusers, and high-speed aircraft points to the increasingimportance of the interaction between shock waves and boundarylayers .  the experimental work reported here is intended to (1)provide a better understanding of the nature of the shockboundary-layer interaction, (2) serve as a guide and stimulus to theoreticalwork, and (3) develop an empirical method for predicting theeffects of the interaction .  experiments were performed on the reflection of an obliqueshock from a boundary layer on a flat surface at a mach numberof 2.05 .  the effects of shock strength and boundary-layer regimewere explored .  the results are in the form of schlieren photographs,constant-density contours found from interferometer photographs, andstatic pressure distributions at the plate surface .
