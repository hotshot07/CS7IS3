an approximate theory of base pressure in two dimensionalflow at supersonic speeds .  an approximate theory of the base pressure in two-dimensional flowat supersonic speeds is presented using asimplified representation ofthe flow and some of the findings of tollmien's work on turbulent mixingin incompressible flow .  good qualitative predictions of the effects ofa boundary layer, of bleed air and of boat-tailing are obtained .
