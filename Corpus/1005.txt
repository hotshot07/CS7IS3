free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic .





free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic .  equations based on newtonian impact theory have been derived and acomputational procedure developed with the aid of several design-typecharts which enable the determination of the aerodynamic forces andmoments acting on arbitrary bodies of revolution undergoing eitherseparate or combined angle-of-attack and pitching motions .  bodies withaxially increasing and decreasing cross-sectional area distributions areconsidered,. nose shapes may be sharp, blunt, or flat faced .  theanalysis considers variations in angle of attack from -90 to 90 andallows for both positive and negative pitching rates of arbitrarymagnitude .  the results are also directly applicable to bodies ineither separate or combined sideslip and yawing maneuvers .
