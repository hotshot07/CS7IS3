on slender airfoil theory for nonequilibrium flow .  an exact linear theory for nonequilibrium flow past a thinairfoil is given .  green's function technique is used to solve theboundary value problem for the governing third order equation .upon satisfying the boundary condition on the airfoil surface anintegral equation is obtained which has an exact solution .  thefinal expression for the velocity potential, given as an integral overthe source strength times the green's function, shows that thesolution is dependent not only on the slope variation of the airfoilbut also on its curvature variation .  this turns out to be the casefor all free-stream mach numbers .  as an example, the supersonic flow past a wedge is considered .
