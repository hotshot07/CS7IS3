foreign-gas injection into a compressible turbulentboundary layer on a flat plate .  the distributed injection of a foreign gas into a compressible,turbulent boundary layer in the absence of a pressure gradient isconsidered .  the analysis is performed within the framework ofthe binary-mixture concept, that is, the primary fluid flowingover the surface represents one component while the injectedspecies represents the second .  calculations have been performed for the injection of heliuminto undissociated air .  the results indicate an effect of machnumber on surface shear and energy transfer when distributedlight-gas injection normal to the surface exists .  a comparisonwith experimental data indicates reasonable agreement over arange of mach numbers .
