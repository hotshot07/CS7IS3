some considerations on the laminar stability of time-dependent basicflows .as a stability criterion for infinitesimal disturbances in anincompressible, parallel but time-dependent basic flow, it is proposedto introduce the concept of /momentary stability,/ which is saidto prevail at the instant if the kinetic energy of the disturbances,as a fraction of the kinetic energy of the basic flow, tends todecrease .  the significance of such a criterion is briefly discussed .for special time-dependent basic flows which are described by similarvelocity profiles at all times (except for changes in amplitude),in the inviscid limit only a change of the time scale is needed toreduce the solution essentially to that for the steady case .  thedisturbances may be of either the transverse-wave or thelongitudinal-vortices type .  the result indicates a very strong destabilizinginfluence of deceleration, which is likely to overshadow that of thevelocity profile under normal circumstances .  the observations of falesrotating cylinders) are believed to be largely due to the deceleration .at finite reynolds numbers, the usual procedure of calculating thestability solution on the basis of the instantaneous profile is furthershown to be valid only for extremely slow acceleration or deceleration .even when the solution is acceptable, the condition for neutralstability may not be used without reservation .  to calculatemomentary stability properly, a procedure for a slowly varying but moregeneral profile is also described .
