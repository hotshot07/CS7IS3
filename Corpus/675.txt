pressure distribution and surface flow on 5( and 9( thick wings withcurved tip and 60degree sweepback .extensive tables are given of pressure coefficients measured at reynolds numbers from 1.3x10 to 3.9x10 on two half-models of identical planformwith 5( rae 101 and 9( rae 101 streamwise sections . the planform ofaspect ratio 3.899 has a straight trailing edge with 60degree ofsweepback, constant chord over most of the span and a parabolic outer portionof the leading edge curving to a pointed tip . the overall wingcharacteristics are obtained from integrated normal pressures and arecompared with lifting-surface theory .the low-speed experimental pressure distributions and surface oil-flowpatterns are analysed and discussed in relation to the onset ofseparation and the distinct vortex flows that develop at highincidence . series of contrasting upper-surface isobars illustrate somefeatures of the different stalling processes of the two wings . thedirect influence of the main vortex on local surface pressures isassessed in general terms . a fuller appraisal of secondary surface flow is obtained from the oil patterns, observations in water andmeasurements of high suction near the trailing edge .studies of the extent of leading-edge stall and location of part-spanvortices, in particular two simultaneous leading-edge vortices on thethinner wing, follow from further analysis of local surface pressures .after a detailed discussion of the effect of reynolds number and thedistinct types of separated flow, a few results with leading-edgeroughness are considered in relation to scale effect on separation andthe extensive influence of part-span roughness .
