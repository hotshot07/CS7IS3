accuracy of approximate methods for predicting pressureon pointed non-lifting bodies of revolution in supersonicflow .  the accuracy and range of applicability of the linearized theory,second-order theory, tangent-cone method, conical-shock-expansion theoryand newtonian theory for predicting pressure distributions on pointedbodies of revolution at zero angle ofattack are investigated .  pressuredistributions and integrated pressuredrag obtained by these methods arecompared with standard values obtainedby the method of characteristicsand the theory of taylor and maccoll .three shapes, cone, ogive, and amodified optimum body, are investigatedover a wide range of finenessratios and mach numbers .  it is found that the linearizedtheory is accurate only at low valuesof the hypersonic similarity parameternumber to body fineness ratio) and thatsecond-order theory appreciablyextends the range of accurate application .the second-order theory givesgood results on ogives when the ratio ofthe tangent of maximum surfaceangle to the tangent of the mach angleis less than 0.9 .  tangent-conemethod cannot be widely applied withgood accuracy .  in general, theconical-shock-expansion theory predictspressure and drag withinengineering accuracy when the hypersonic similarityparameter is greater than 1.2 .although newtonian theory gives good accuracy,except for cones, at thehighest values of the hypersonic similarityparameter investigated, it isless accurate than the conical-shock-expansion theory .
